NOTES FOR JOE AND EMMA
----------------------

Talk about ideas (narrow in on next steps):
- Phases across clinicaltrials.gov and pubmed data regarding these diseases? 
- Drug network for clinicaltrials.gov compared to the same for pubmed? (find pubmed drugs using “unique_drugs” variable made using clinicaltrials.gov data in "2 Creating Master Dataset")
- Treatment results and progression would just be difficult to find and clean for clinicaltrials.gov data, but maybe we could map easier-to-find variables to free text analysis of pubmed abstracts?

Other analyses: 
- Gender, enrollment #, and age groups considered across years and diseases? 
- Drugs considered across years, prevalence of those drugs, are some drugs used for multiple diseases? Maybe select only the most prevalent to do further analysis on.
- How to consider drug codes?
