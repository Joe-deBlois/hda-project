Separate items are rated from 0 (absent) to 5 (severe), so that higher values represent a worse outcome. Total score is equal to the sum of the seven items plus the global hallucinations, plus the global delusions. Therefore a total possible score on the SAPS-PD ranges from 0 to 45.

The subdomain score is the product of these two measures and ranges from 0 to 12. The combined NPI score is obtained by summing all 12 sub-domain scores and therefore ranges from 0 to 144.
