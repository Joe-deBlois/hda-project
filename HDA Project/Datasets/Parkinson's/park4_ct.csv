The total scores for Apathy Evaluation Scale ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 42 (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Total Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II (Activities of Daily Living) + III (Motor Symptoms), Part II of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses the subject's activities of daily living. Part III assesses motor function. The UPDRS is completed by questioning the subject about his/her general state in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee) since the previous visit. Part II is subject-rated and Part III is physician-rated. The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score was calculated as the sum of these 13 individual scores. The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) consists of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score was calculated as sum of these 27 individual scores. The sum score of UPDRS Parts II and III is the sum of the corresponding single sum scores. A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)","Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Score of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AS) Rated by the Caregiver (Where Available), The Apathy Scale (AS) is an abbreviated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. The AS (Starkstein et al, 1992) consists of 14 items phrased as questions by the examiner that are to be answered on a 4-point Likert scale. It was developed specifically for subjects with Parkinson's disease because the Apathy Evaluation Scale was considered too demanding.

The questions comprising the AS were answered by the caregiver. The questions were asked in a structured interview format. The caregiver was interviewed by appropriate medical staff and asked questions about the subject in the third person.The total scores for Apathy Evaluation Scale ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 42 (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the 8-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), The 8-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) (Peto et al, 1998) is a self-administered questionnaire that provides a reliable measure of overall health status. The PDQ-8 collects 8 items with 5 categories each (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=always or cannot do at all). The total score was calculated by summing the scores of all applicable questions and convert the resulting sum to a summary index score between 0 and 100 by multiplying with 100/32. A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Mood / Cognition Domain of the Nonmotor Symptom Assessment Scale (NMSS), Nonmotor performance was assessed via the Nonmotor Symptom Assessment Scale (NMSS), an accepted scale that has been validated in an international study (Naidu et al, 2006; Chaudhuri et al, 2007), at the Baseline Visit as well as at the end of the Maintenance Period. The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms were assessed by the investigator (or designee) in the following 9 domain categories: cardiovascular, including falls; sleep/fatigue; mood/cognition; perceptual problems/hallucinations; attention/memory; gastrointestinal tract; urinary; sexual function; and miscellaneous.

Items are scored for severity (from 0 (none) to 3 (severe)) and frequency (from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent )). The score was calculated as severity x frequency. The theoretical minimum is 0 (best possible outcome) and maximum total score is 360 points (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), The Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) (Snaith et al, 1995) is a self-report instrument developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity. The sum of the 14 items scores range from 0 to 14. A higher score represents more anhedonic symptoms., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II), The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a self-report instrument to measure depression symptoms and severity (Beck et al, 1961). The BDI-II is a revised version of the scale in order to be more consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for depression (Beck et al, 1996). There are 21 items in the BDI-II, classified as cognitive-affective (Items 1-13) and somatic-performance (Items 14-21) subscales. The degree of severity is indicated on a 4-point scale; items are rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (extreme form of each symptom). Scores of 0-13 indicate minimal depression, 14-19 indicate mild depression, 20-28 indicate moderate depression, and 29-63 indicate severe depression., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (Motor Subscale) in ""on"" State, Part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses motor function. The UPDRS is completed by questioning the subject about his/her general state in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee) since the previous visit.

The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) had to be measured in the ""on"" state and consisted of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score ranged between 0 and 108 and was calculated as sum of the 27 individual scores. If 1 or more items were missing and could not be substituted with a previous post-Baseline value, the sum score was also missing.

A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Score of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) Item I (Severity of Illness), The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales (Guy and Bonato, 1970) were initially developed for a risk-benefit estimation within the treatment of mentally ill patients. The 4 global scales (severity of illness, change in severity from Baseline, therapeutic efficacy, and tolerability of treatment) are used as different measures of treatment outcome in different kinds of pharmacological studies.

The CGI Item 1 (severity of illness) collected 1 answer out of 8 categories (0-'Not assessed', 1-'Normal, not at all ill', 2-'Borderline ill', 3-'Mildly ill', 4-'Moderately ill', 5-'Markedly ill', 6-'Severely ill', and 7-'Among the most extremely ill patients') at each assessment. The category 0-'Not assessed' was considered as missing and therefore used neither for calculation nor for display purposes., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period/Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)",,UCB BIOSCIENCES GmbH,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,122,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",PD0005|2012-002840-26,2013-02,2014-01,2014-03,2013-02-01,2015-01-19,2018-08-31,"4320, Birmingham, Alabama, United States|4309, Oxnard, California, United States|4306, Ormond Beach, Florida, United States|4311, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, United States|4313, Tampa, Florida, United States|4314, Decatur, Georgia, United States|4318, Chicago, Illinois, United States|4316, Winfield, Illinois, United States|4322, Des Moines, Iowa, United States|4304, Kansas City, Kansas, United States|4326, Springfield, Massachusetts, United States|4330, Ocean Springs, Mississippi, United States|4302, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States|4303, Commack, New York, United States|4317, New York, New York, United States|4323, New York, New York, United States|4319, Asheville, North Carolina, United States|4325, Charlotte, North Carolina, United States|4329, Akron, Ohio, United States|4312, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States|4324, Beaufort, South Carolina, United States|4332, Charleston, South Carolina, United States|4305, San Antonio, Texas, United States|4307, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States|4333, Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States|3001, Innsbruck, Austria|3003, Linz, Austria|3301, Budapest, Hungary|3302, Debrecen, Hungary|3509, Gdansk, Poland|3506, Gdynia, Poland|3504, Poznan, Poland|3801, Banská Bystrica, Slovakia|3805, Bratislava, Slovakia|3806, Krompachy, Slovakia|3807, Žilina, Slovakia|3901, Ljubljana, Slovenia|4001, Barcelona, Spain|4006, Barcelona, Spain|4009, Oviedo, Spain|4005, Seville, Spain|4010, Seville, Spain",
NCT01470859,The Effect of Pramipexole on Metabolic Network Activity Compared With Levodopa in Early Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01470859,,COMPLETED,"Levodopa and non-ergot dopaminergic agonists such as pramipexole are both recommended as the first-line symptomatic treatment for early untreated Parkinson's disease (PD), previous clinical trial indicated that initial pramipexole owns advantage over levodopa regarding motor complications, on the contrary, less adverse effect like freezing and severe somnolence favors initial treatment of levodopa. Thus, it remains controversial that initiation of which medication will be better for those patients with early PD.

Parkinson's disease-related spatial covariance patter (PDRP) is a new biomarker which can represent the network activity of brain and severity of PD. Based on the literatures and our previous data, the investigators hypothesize that PDRP will be served as a biomarker to help us evaluate and compare the effect of levodopa or pramipexole on the progression of PD, which might be able to provide further evidence for clinicians to address the above critical issue.",YES,Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: pramipexole|DRUG: Sinemet CR,"Longitudinal Change of Brain Network Activity, The brain network activity is evaluated by Parkinson's disease-related spatial covariance pattern(PDRP) value (Z score).

* UPDRS II self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADLs) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food
* UPDRS III clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation The UPDRS I, II and III scores and subscores are calculated as the sum of all individual items. If one or two items in a scale are missing, they will be imputed with the mean of the non-missing items of that scale.

Subscale has 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe

The PDSS score is calculated as the sum of all single items. If one or two items are missing, they will be imputed with the mean of the non-missing items. If three or more items are missing, no imputation will be done and the score will be set to missing.

Subscale has 0-10 ratings, where 0 = severe and 10 = normal

The PDSS total score is a sum score of all 15 questions and ranges from 0 to 150, with lower scores meaning more disability., 14-15 weeks|Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), The Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) consists of 30 questions, covering 9 dimensions, whereby each item is scored for severity and frequency: Severity None 0 Mild (symptoms present but causes little distress) 1 Moderate (some distress or disturbance to subject) 2 Severe (major source of distress or disturbance to subject) 3

Frequency Rarely (\<1/wk) 1 Often (1/wk) 2 Frequent (several times per week) 3 Very Frequent (daily or all the time) 4

The product of frequency and severity is calculated for each item and each dimension score is defined as the sum of the frequency\*severity of the respective items. If frequency or severity of a single item is missing, the domain score will not be calculated. The NMSS total score is defined as the sum of all domain scores.

The NMSS total score is calculated by adding all domain scores (0-360), and lower scores mean less disability., 14-15 weeks",,Bial - Portela C S.A.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,427,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",BIA-91067-302|2010-022366-27|BIA-91067-302,2011-03,2012-07,2012-07,2010-10-25,2015-01-13,2015-10-19,"Bial - Portela & Cª, S.A., S.

Eligible patients are required to meet the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank Clinical Diagnostic Criteria. The study involves a placebo group. Placebo will be added to the standard stabilized treatment as a control of the safinamide group, hence patients on placebo will have benefit from other ongoing anti-PD medication. A total of 306 patients will be randomised into this study (153 in the safinamide and 153 in the placebo groups).",YES,Parkinson Disease,DRUG: Safinamide|OTHER: Placebo,"Change From Baseline to Week 16 in the Mean Total Daily ""OFF"" Time, The mean total daily ""OFF"" time was assessed by 24-hour patient diary cards, of safinamide 100 mg/day compared to placebo, given as add-on therapy in PD patients with motor fluctuations on stable doses of L-dopa. Patients completed the daily diary by selecting one of the following five options for each 30-minute time period:

* ""OFF"" (Stiffness, marked decrease in mobility, or immobility).
* ""ON"" without dyskinesia (Good or practically normal mobility without dyskinesia).
