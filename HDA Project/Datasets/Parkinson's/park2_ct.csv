NCT02610634,Visual Function During Gait in Parkinson's Disease: Impact of Cognition and Response to Visual Cues,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02610634,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with problems of gait such as veering, difficulty turning, an inability to perceive doorways or obstacles, and negotiate uneven terrain. Gait problems, especially veering, may be exacerbated by visuospatial dysfunction which predispose to falls, freezing and festination of gait. Visuospatial dysfunction is common in PD and likely involves peripheral features (e.g. contrast sensitivity) as well as central cognitive mechanisms (e.g. attention).

Central neuro-degeneration in PD, PD dementia, and dementia with Lewy Bodies may influence visual function, as impaired visual sampling has been reported in these conditions. Visual sampling is measured via saccadic (fast eye movement) activity, as saccades are the mechanisms through which people orientate and explore the environment. The use of objective devices to reliably measure saccades is important to detect disease related eye movement changes. Emerging visuomotor research has measured visual sampling in PD using devices such as electrooculography and infra-red eye tracking, revealing reduced amplitude, speed and frequency of saccades during various tasks.

Despite recent increases in visuomotor research it remains unclear how PD influences visual sampling of the environment during gait and the influence of attentional and cognitive deficits. Recent work demonstrated that people with PD sample their environment less frequently than controls, despite a slower gait. Saccadic timing was unchanged in response to environmental cues. Despite this, environmental visual cues (transverse lines on the floor) have been shown to increase the number of fixations made during gait. However the mechanisms of this response remain unclear. Cognition is likely of importance, with response potentially influenced by attentional control.

This observational study aims to examine the influence of cognition on visuomotor control during gait in PD. This aim will be achieved by observation of visual sampling under several environmental challenges (straight walk, doorways, turns, visual cue) and a dual task.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,,"Visual Sampling Parameter: Saccade Frequency During Gait, Number of fast eye movements made per second observed when walking, measured via EOG and Dikablis mobile eye-tracker.

The glymphatic system is a recentlydiscovered novel waste clearance pathway, in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD).The glymphatic system acts as a waste-clearance system in the brain of vertebrate animals.The glymphatic system has been proposed in which new clearance pathways involving communication between paravascular spaces, interstitial fluid, and ultimately meningeal and dural lymphatic vessels exists, and we have provided evidence that this system may be dysfunctional in patients with Parkinson's disease with cognitive disorders. Early research suggest glymphatic function increases following exercise, this response is believed to clear beta-amyloid in the brain and may mediate the neurobehavioral response to exercise in PD.

Current medicines for PD only improve symptoms, treatments that slow disease progression are needed, and earlier diagnosis of PD may be the key to their development. PD symptoms can be mimicked by medicines (most commonly antipsychotic drugs that block dopamine), and some of these patients actually have underlying ""prodromal"" PD that was ""unmasked"" years before it would have caused symptoms. This problem is increasing as these medicines are now used for common conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. The investigators will identify prodromal PD in patients with drug-induced symptoms using brain scans. These patients will be enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of aerobic exercise which slows progression in animal models of PD and has other health benefits. The investigators will measure the effect of exercise on symptoms, disease progression (using brain scans) and markers of PD risk (using blood tests).

NCT01782222,Trial to Evaluate The Efficacy Of Rotigotine on Parkinson's Disease-Associated Motor Symptoms And Apathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01782222,BRIGHT,COMPLETED,This trial is being conducted to assess the effects of Rotigotine over Placebo on improvement of Apathy and motor symptoms in subjects with early-stage and advanced stage idiopathic Parkinson´s Disease.,YES,Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: Rotigotine|OTHER: Placebo,"Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Score of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AS) Rated by the Patient, The Apathy Scale (AS) is an abbreviated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. The AS (Starkstein et al, 1992) consists of 14 items phrased as questions by the examiner that are to be answered on a 4-point Likert scale. It was developed specifically for subjects with Parkinson's disease because the Apathy Evaluation Scale was considered too demanding.

The questions comprising the AS were answered by the subject. The total scores for Apathy Evaluation Scale ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 42 (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Total Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts II (Activities of Daily Living) + III (Motor Symptoms), Part II of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses the subject's activities of daily living. Part III assesses motor function. The UPDRS is completed by questioning the subject about his/her general state in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee) since the previous visit. Part II is subject-rated and Part III is physician-rated. The UPDRS Part II (Activities of Daily Living) consists of 13 items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score was calculated as the sum of these 13 individual scores. The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) consists of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score was calculated as sum of these 27 individual scores. The sum score of UPDRS Parts II and III is the sum of the corresponding single sum scores. A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)","Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Score of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AS) Rated by the Caregiver (Where Available), The Apathy Scale (AS) is an abbreviated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. The AS (Starkstein et al, 1992) consists of 14 items phrased as questions by the examiner that are to be answered on a 4-point Likert scale. It was developed specifically for subjects with Parkinson's disease because the Apathy Evaluation Scale was considered too demanding.

The questions comprising the AS were answered by the caregiver. The questions were asked in a structured interview format. The caregiver was interviewed by appropriate medical staff and asked questions about the subject in the third person.The total scores for Apathy Evaluation Scale ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 42 (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the 8-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), The 8-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) (Peto et al, 1998) is a self-administered questionnaire that provides a reliable measure of overall health status. The PDQ-8 collects 8 items with 5 categories each (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=always or cannot do at all). The total score was calculated by summing the scores of all applicable questions and convert the resulting sum to a summary index score between 0 and 100 by multiplying with 100/32. A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Mood / Cognition Domain of the Nonmotor Symptom Assessment Scale (NMSS), Nonmotor performance was assessed via the Nonmotor Symptom Assessment Scale (NMSS), an accepted scale that has been validated in an international study (Naidu et al, 2006; Chaudhuri et al, 2007), at the Baseline Visit as well as at the end of the Maintenance Period. The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms were assessed by the investigator (or designee) in the following 9 domain categories: cardiovascular, including falls; sleep/fatigue; mood/cognition; perceptual problems/hallucinations; attention/memory; gastrointestinal tract; urinary; sexual function; and miscellaneous.

Items are scored for severity (from 0 (none) to 3 (severe)) and frequency (from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent )). The score was calculated as severity x frequency. The theoretical minimum is 0 (best possible outcome) and maximum total score is 360 points (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), The Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) (Snaith et al, 1995) is a self-report instrument developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity. The sum of the 14 items scores range from 0 to 14. A higher score represents more anhedonic symptoms., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II), The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a self-report instrument to measure depression symptoms and severity (Beck et al, 1961). The BDI-II is a revised version of the scale in order to be more consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for depression (Beck et al, 1996). There are 21 items in the BDI-II, classified as cognitive-affective (Items 1-13) and somatic-performance (Items 14-21) subscales. The degree of severity is indicated on a 4-point scale; items are rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (extreme form of each symptom). Scores of 0-13 indicate minimal depression, 14-19 indicate mild depression, 20-28 indicate moderate depression, and 29-63 indicate severe depression., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (Motor Subscale) in ""on"" State, Part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses motor function. The UPDRS is completed by questioning the subject about his/her general state in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee) since the previous visit.

The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) had to be measured in the ""on"" state and consisted of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score ranged between 0 and 108 and was calculated as sum of the 27 individual scores. If 1 or more items were missing and could not be substituted with a previous post-Baseline value, the sum score was also missing.

A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Score of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) Item I (Severity of Illness), The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales (Guy and Bonato, 1970) were initially developed for a risk-benefit estimation within the treatment of mentally ill patients. The 4 global scales (severity of illness, change in severity from Baseline, therapeutic efficacy, and tolerability of treatment) are used as different measures of treatment outcome in different kinds of pharmacological studies.

The CGI Item 1 (severity of illness) collected 1 answer out of 8 categories (0-'Not assessed', 1-'Normal, not at all ill', 2-'Borderline ill', 3-'Mildly ill', 4-'Moderately ill', 5-'Markedly ill', 6-'Severely ill', and 7-'Among the most extremely ill patients') at each assessment.

The ketogenic diet uses fats as a person's major energy source rather than carbohydrates. There is increasing interest in using this diet to treat neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Researchers want to learn more about the ketogenic diet before recommending this diet in clinical practice.

Objective:

To study the effects of a ketogenic diet for someone with PD.

Eligibility:

People over age 50 with mild to moderate PD.

Design:

Participants will be screened with surveys and a 10-foot walking test. They will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood test.

Participants will be contacted twice in a 1-week period to discuss what they ate over the last 24 hours. They will log data about their daily exercise and activities using an online fitness tracking app.

Participants will stay at NIH Clinical Center for 1 week. They will be put into 1 of 2 groups. One group will follow a ketogenic diet and take MCT oil. The other group will follow a low-fat diet. Their body measurements will be taken. They will meet with a physical therapist and nutritionist.

Participants will have daily respiratory and glucose monitoring. They will have cognitive tests and complete surveys. They will have walking, motor function, and reaction time/finger tapping tests. They will have heart and nerve function tests. They will have electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms. Blood will be taken twice daily.

Participants will follow the ketogenic diet at home for 2 weeks. They will log their activities using the fitness tracking app. Then they will have a follow-up visit at NIH.

The safety and potential benefits of tDCS to children or adults patients who are paralyzed because of brain damage are reported in the medical literature. In addition, some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience improvement in memory and report better use of the hand after tDCS. The treatment requires putting electrodes (pads) over the head and sending very small amount of electrical current that the patient may feel as ""little tingling"". Application of tDCS takes 20 min. In this study we wish to test if tDCS application can improve stepping and walking ability of subjects with PD and if the improvement is the same as when walking on treadmill. We plan to test the subject's ability to step when pulled by a laboratory testing system and also test his/her walking ability. There will be 3 sessions 7 days apart. In the first session the subject will be tested then treated for 20 min with tDCS and then tested again.

NCT01399905,High and Low Dose Carbidopa Treatment of Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01399905,,COMPLETED,"Hypothesis: We hypothesize that carbidopa in daily doses of 450mg will enter the central nervous system and partially inhibit AAAD, thereby reducing the decarboxylation of exogenous levodopa to dopamine, and thereby blunt the therapeutic effects of levodopa in PD subjects.

The purpose of this study is to see how low dose vs. high dose of the study drug, carbidopa effect movement in subjects with Parkinson's disease. The low dose of the study drug is 75 mg and the high dose is 450mg.

Subjects will be recruited from the investigators clinic when they are seen for treatment for Parkinson's disease. Subjects will also be recruited through flyers hung at OHSU and at the VA.

Subjects will take part in 2 screening visits one week apart to determine eligibility. Subjects will be randomly chosen to start either high or low dose carbidopa and take it for 4 weeks. Subjects will be called 2, 4, and 6 or 7 days after this visit to ask how they are doing after starting this dose of study drug. We will leave them a message if we cannot reach them. If there are any problems, we will schedule them to come to the clinic within the next 2 days.

Subjects will have an outpatient visit 2 weeks after screening and a hospital admission 2 weeks after that. At the hospital, subjects will stay for 3 days. They will have blood drawn and their Parkinson's disease assessed by a finger tapping exercise, timing their walking, and looking at their uncontrolled movements.

The subject will then receive the opposite dose of carbidopa for 4 weeks. Subjects will be called 2, 4, and 6 or 7 days after this visit to ask how they are doing after starting this dose of study drug. We will leave them a message if we cannot reach them. If there are any problems, we will schedule them to come to the clinic within the next 2 days.

The outpatient visit and hospital admission will repeat again. At the end of the second hospital admission, treatment on the study is over and subjects will go back to their original Parkinson's disease medications.

NCT00640159,Selegiline to Zelapar Switch Study in Parkinson Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00640159,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Symptomatic therapy is primarily aimed at restoring dopamine function in the brain. Oral selegiline in conjunction with L-dopa has been a mainstay of therapy for PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations for many years. The mechanisms accounting for selegiline's beneficial adjunctive action in the treatment of PD are not fully understood. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B (MAO-B) activity is generally considered to be of primary importance.

Oral selegiline has low bio-availability and is typically dosed BID, for a total of 5-10 mg daily. Recently, the FDA approved a new orally disintegration tablet (ODT) formulation of selegiline, called ZelaparTM. This new formulation utilizes Zydis technology to dissolve in the mouth, with absorption through the oral mucosa, thereby largely bypassing the gut and avoiding first pass hepatic metabolism. This allows more active drug to be delivered at a lower dose. Consequently, Zelapar is dosed once-daily, up to 2.5 mg per day. There are no empirical data indicating whether the use of the new approved formulation of selegiline ODT (Zelapar) is superior or preferred by patients compared to traditional oral selegiline. It is believed that clinical efficacy will be preserved or enhanced, by delivering more active drug, with improved patient preference for the ODT formulation due to the once-daily dosing .

The effectiveness of orally disintegrating selegiline as an adjunct to carbidopa/levodopa in the treatment of PD was established in a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial (n=140; 94 received orally disintegrating selegiline, 46 received placebo) of three months' duration. Patients randomized to orally disintegrating selegiline received a daily dose of 1.25 mg for the first 6 weeks and a daily dose of 2.5 mg for the last 6 weeks. Patients were all treated with levodopa and could additionally have been on dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination of these during the trial. At 12 weeks, orally disintegrating selegiline-treated patients had an average of 2.2 hours per day less ""OFF"" time compared to baseline. Placebo treated patients had 0.6 hours per day less ""OFF"" time compared to baseline. These differences were significant (p \< 0.001). Adverse events were very similar between drug and placebo.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: Zelapar,"Clinical Global Impression Scale, Baseline assessments included a clinical global impression scale.

NCT02206620,Effects of Cholinergic Augmentation on Measures of Balance and Gait,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02206620,,COMPLETED,"This study will compare the effects of placebo and donepezil, a drug that helps conserve concentrations of the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, on measures of balance and gait in subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD). This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over randomized clinical trial. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a physiological index of cholinergic function will be measured to determine if the deficits in balance and gait correlate with abnormalities of the SAI and if SAI is altered by donepezil as a measure of drug efficacy. Cognitive tests like the Attention Network Test (ANT) will be administered to determine if changes in gait and balance are mediated by changes in attention.

The results of this study will be the most direct test of the hypothesized role of cholinergic neurons and the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine in terms of gait and balance. The study is exploratory because it is not known whether donepezil will affect gait, balance or attention, nor which measures of gait, balance or attention will be sensitive to drug manipulation. The study's immediate goal is to determine the potential utility of cholinergic manipulation as a strategy for preventing or treating balance and gait dysfunction in PD. The findings of this trial are intended to lead to more sharply focused questions about the role of cholinergic neurons in balance and gait and eventually to Phase II B trials to determine clinical utility of cholinergic manipulation to prevent falls and improve mobility.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: Donepezil,"Delta Medio-lateral Postural Sway Range (Foam), Increased body sway while standing may be markers for increased risk of falling in Parkinson's disease.

Details: In accordance with Fan et al. (2002), the subtraction method was applied to isolate the efficiency of the three attentional networks as follows: for the alerting network efficiency: mean RT NC trials - mean RT DC trials; for the orienting network efficiency: mean RT CC trials - mean RT SC trials; and for the executive network efficiency: mean RT I trials - mean RT C trials.

This study measures the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ABBV-951 versus oral Levodopa (LD)/Carbidopa (CD) \[LD/CD\] in advanced PD participants to achieve reduction in motor fluctuations.

ABBV-951 is an investigational (unapproved) drug containing Levodopa Phosphate/Carbidopa Phosphate (LDP/CDP) given subcutaneously (under the skin) for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. Adult participants with advanced PD will be enrolled. Approximately 130 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 80 sites across the world.

In one arm, participants will receive ABBV-951 solution as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral placebo capsules for LD/CD. In the second arm, participants will receive placebo solution for ABBV-951 as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral capsules containing LD/CD tablets. The treatment duration is 12 weeks.

Each item was scored on 5-point scale: 0 = Never (better in outcome), 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (worse in outcome). Total scores ranged between 0 to 156. Higher scores indicated poor quality of life. Baseline was Visit 1 (Day 1) or Visit 3 (Day 29); Post-Baseline was Visit 2 (Day 14) or Visit 4 (Day 42). Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value., Baseline; Post-Baseline (Day 14 or 42)|Change From Baseline in PDQ-39 Single Index (PDQ-39-SI) Scores at the End of Each Treatment Period, The PDQ-39 was the most widely used PD-specific measure of health status. It consists of 39 questions, covering 8 aspects of quality of life: mobility; activities of daily living; emotional wellbeing; stigma; social support; cognitive impairment (cognitions); communication; bodily discomfort. The instrument was developed on the basis of interviews with people diagnosed with PD. The PDQ-39-SI) score was calculated as the weighted addition of scores on all 8 dimensions of the PDQ-39. The total score ranged from 0 (no disease impact) to 100 (severe disease impact). Baseline was Visit 1 (Day 1) or Visit 3 (Day 29); Post-Baseline was Visit 2 (Day 14) or Visit 4 (Day 42).

NCT03329508,A Phase 3 Study With P2B001 in Subjects With Early Parkinson's,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03329508,,COMPLETED,"P2B001 is an investigational drug that comprised of low doses of two drugs, pramipexole and rasagiline, which are both approved drugs and routinely used in standard therapy for Parkinson's disease. The two drugs work in two different mechanisms that help each other, so there is a reason to believe that their combined activity will be better than each individual drug, and that lower doses can be used without losing the therapeutic effect. Thus, the development of P2B001 is intended to provide a combination of low doses of these two drugs, in an improved formulation, that is hoped to be more effective in controlling Parkinson's disease symptoms and with less side effects than each of the drugs taken alone or the current available commercial drugs taken together. In a previously completed clinical trial a significant improvement in Parkinson's disease symptoms was seen in patients treated with P2B001 compared to patients that were treated with placebo.

In this phase 3 study , the safety and efficacy of P2B001 will be assessed by comparing P2B001 to its individual components pramipexole and rasagiline. This will be done by monitoring the motor and non-motor symptoms, evaluating responses participants provide on questionnaires relating to Parkinson's disease and quality of life that will be completed on every visit.

NCT02184494,Blood Lactate Concentrations With and Without Exercise in Parkinson's Disease and Multiple Sclerosis Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02184494,PDMSLac,COMPLETED,"Fatigue is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms experienced in Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS). There are multiple proposed mechanisms of disorder-related fatigue, however, it is unknown whether PD or MS patients experience compromised blood lactate responses to an acute bout of exercise, subjecting them to exercise-related fatigue. These populations may experience higher energy expenditure at rest due to increased rigidity, however, limited data exists investigating resting energy expenditure in these populations.

Researchers hypothesize that PD and MS patients will display higher resting energy expenditure than healthy age-matched controls, and that level of energy expenditure will correlate with amount of rigidity or spasticity.

NCT03192046,Bracing for Walking in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03192046,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that results in characteristic gait dysfunction. Gait problems include decreased velocity, decreased stride length, difficulty with initiation of gait, postural stability problems and alteration in joint kinematics.1 In this typically older patient population, these gait deviations affect their participation in household and community activities. The standard of care is currently focused on therapeutic exercise and cueing of various types (visual, auditory, verbal). Current interventions have not been demonstrated to markedly improve gait kinematics, so there is a need to identify interventions that could improve gait performance in this population. Lower extremity bracing is a common and well-established intervention for gait dysfunction with other populations, including stroke and brain injury. The braces allow for improved stability, sensory feedback, and consistent tactile cues to allow patients to have the best gait mechanics with each step. It is reasonable to hypothesize that appropriate bracing may have the potential to improve gait function and kinematics in PD since these patient often have gastroc-soleus weakness. Data from our early pilot studies indicates that bracing individuals with PD can positively impact their mobility. This includes improvements in velocity, step length, and dynamic balance.

The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at 6 months. While the total distance covered during six minutes (6MWTD) is often used as the standard measurement of gait capacity (i.e., the maximum distance one can achieve), the endurance (i.e., ability to maintain speed over a prolonged time) can be inferred by the gait speed trajectory (GST) during the 6MW test (6MWGST)., Baseline and 6 months","Change in Step Length, Participants will be asked to walk on a 12-16 foot long vinyl pad placed on the floor.

NCT01768832,Exercise and Parkinson's: Comparing Interventions and Exploring Neural Mechanisms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01768832,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by substantial disability and reduced quality of life, both of which can be attributed in large part to difficulties with walking. Evidence suggests that exercise may be an important addition to traditional treatments, particularly with respect to addressing walking problems. In particular, dance and treadmill training have been individually shown to improve walking performance and quality of life. At present it is not clear whether dance or treadmill training have similar effects or if one is superior to the other. Furthermore, our understanding of the means by which these exercise interventions convey benefits is extremely limited. This study aims to address these knowledge gaps by directly comparing dance, treadmill training and stretching (control group). The primary area of interest is the effects on gait, with secondary measures of disease severity, balance, and quality of life. The investigators will determine not only the effects of the interventions on walking performance, but will also investigate the effects of the interventions on connections between different parts of the brain and on brain function during imagined walking tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will be randomly assigned to dance, treadmill training, or a stretching/flexibility control group. Participants will be assessed over a period of 6 months at 3 different time points. The investigators hypothesize that both dance and treadmill training will lead to improvements in forward walking, but that dance will result in greater improvements in backward walking compared to treadmill training. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the tango and treadmill interventions will have different effects of brain function and brain connections. The investigators expect dance to enhance the activity and connections of particular brain regions and treadmill training to enhance activity and connections of different brain regions.

The participant's score is calculated as a sum of the scores of the 17 individual questions. This sum score ranges from 0 to 108. Higher scores denote greater disability.

A participant has been considered ""OFF"" when he/she has been off L-dopa for greater than 12 hours. During ""OFF"" time, the participant will not report feeling the effects of their anti-Parkinson's medication. The participant recorded the exact time of L-dopa intake. Assessment was only conducted greater than 12 hours after dosing with the participant reportedly feeling ""OFF."", From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to 54 weeks)|Change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) Total Score From Baseline to the End of the Double-Blind Maintenance Period, The NMSS is a 30-item rater-based scale to assess a wide range of non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. The NMSS measures severity and frequency of non-motor symptoms across nine dimensions (cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/apathy, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous which includes pain, taste/smell, weight change, and excessive sweating). Higher scores indicate a higher burden of these symptoms on the patient.

There are 30 items to be scored, and the item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; the total score is obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS total score ranges from 0 to 360 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms., From Baseline (Week 0) to the End of Maintenance Period (up to Week 54)|Change in the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS-2) From Baseline to the End of Double-Blind Maintenance Period, The DRS-2 assesses individuals in five areas resulting in five sub-scale scores. These scores are used to determine the overall score and level of cognitive functioning ability. The five areas include:

Attention - measured using eight items Construction - measured using six items Conceptualization - measured using six items Initiation/Preservation - measured using eleven items Memory - measured using five items Higher raw scores indicate better cognitive status, with scores ranging from 0 to 144.

The HOMA-IR tool is a validated, non-invasive tool to assess the relationship between glucose and insulin. A score less than 1 means indicates insulin-sensitivity (Optimal). Greater than 1.9 indicates early insulin resistance, and a score greater than 2.9 indicates significant insulin resistance.

An increase in one's HOMA-IR score may indicate increased insulin resistance., From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to 54 weeks)|Change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Total Score From Baseline to the End of Double-Blind Maintenance Period, Total UPDRS Score (Parts I, II, III, and IV; administered in the ON condition) Change from Baseline to End of Maintenance Period.

The UPDRS I, II, III, and IV scores and subscores are calculated as the sum of all individual items.

Subscales have 0-4 ratings, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe

The final cumulative score will range from 0 (no disability) to 260 (total disability).

Over 40,000 Veterans across the Veterans Health Administration are diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD), a chronic condition that affects motor function as well as cognition, mood, sleep, and autonomic function. There are not enough subspecialists to manage every Veteran with Parkinson's disease. However, a care model of nurse care managers as catalysts and advocates using needs assessments, evidence-based protocols, and VHA and community access coordination mechanisms to optimize Parkinson's disease care may improve quality of Parkinson's disease care and patient-centered outcomes. If efficacious, this model may be practical to disseminate via an existing VHA national consortium network for Parkinson's disease.

Objectives are (1) to implement then analyze via a randomized controlled trial whether a nurse-led, coordinated care management intervention, Care Coordination for Health Promotion and Activities in Parkinson's Disease (CHAPS), compared to usual care will improve adherence to evidence-based practice guidelines and improve health outcomes in Veterans with Parkinson's disease in a region of the southwest United States, and (2) to analyze extent of implementation of the CHAPS intervention and its costs to determine how the intervention can be made sustainable and disseminated throughout Veterans Affairs Medical Centers if efficacious.",YES,Parkinson Disease,OTHER: Coordinated care management for Parkinson's disease|OTHER: Educational handout,"Proportion of Measures Adhered To in the PD Guidelines, Adherence to quality measures for Parkinson's disease care during study period.

TMS is a method of brain stimulation that may be able to change the activity of the nerve cells of the brain. This study will examine the effects of a specific pattern of stimulation called intermittent theta-burst TMS (iTBS), which uses repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts.

People with mild to moderately severe Parkinson's disease who are between 40 and 80 years of age and whose main problems are slow movement and stiffness may be eligible for this study.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Random assignment to real or placebo (sham) iTBS treatment.
* iTBS sessions (real or sham) 4 times a week for 2 consecutive weeks. For this test, the subject sits in a comfortable chair. A wire coil is held on the subject's scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg.
* Test of gait (walk), hand and arm movements before and after each session. The gait test requires walking 10 meters (about 30 yards) in the same corridor with the same shoes.
* Extended testing. The first and last gait tests (done before starting iTBS and after the eighth session) require coming off any Parkinson's medication for at least 12 hours before the test.

The patient is told to tell the examiner the name of each picture and is given about 20 seconds to respond for each trial. The examiner writes down the patient's responses in detail, using codes. If the patient fails to give the correct response, the examiner at her or his discretion may give the patient a phonemic cue, which is the initial sound of the target word. After the patient completes the test, the examiner scores each item + or - according to the response coding and scoring procedures., Baseline and 6 Months|Verbal Fluency Test, The Verbal Fluency Test has two conditions, Letter Verbal Fluency and Category Verbal Fluency.

The task ratings and scales are calculated into a summed NFOG-Q score. Part I detected the presence of FOG using a dichotomous item in which individuals were classified as a freezer (FR) or a non-freezer (NFR) if they had experienced FOG-episodes during the past month. Parts II and III were designed for FRs only, providing a total summed score between 0 and 28. Part II (items 2-6, scoring range 0-19) rated the severity of FOG based on its duration and frequency in its most common manifestation, i.e. during turning and initiation of gait. Part III rated the impact of FOG on daily life (items 7-9, scoring range 0-9).

NCT03301272,Effectiveness of Botox on Reducing Rest Tremor in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03301272,,COMPLETED,"Purpose: Rest tremor in Parkinson's disease is notoriously difficult to treat through pharmacological measures, currently only predictably attenuated by the invasive deep brain stimulation surgery. The investigators hope to find some predictable and clinically meaningful attenuation of tremor with targeted use of onabotulinum toxin on muscles involved in creating the tremor.

Participants: 16 subjects who meet United Kingdom (UK) brain bank criteria for Parkinson's disease with medically refractory rest tremor of at least 3 cm amplitude.

Procedures (methods): Subjects will be blinded to receive either sham saline injection versus onabotulinum toxin injections directed to muscle groups felt to be clinically involved in causing the oscillatory movement of the tremor. Assessment of tremor severity and functional improvement from baseline after injection will occur within group (i.e. each subject will serve as their own control).

Hypotheses:

1\. (A) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly attenuates the amplitude of medically-refractory rest tremor of the upper limb in Parkinson's patients as compared to sham injections; as measured by reduction in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) tremor subscore.

1\. (B) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly improves the limb function of Parkinson's patients with medically-refractory rest tremor of the upper limb as compared to sham injections; as measured by an increase in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores.",YES,Parkinson Disease,DRUG: Onabotulinumtoxin A Injection|OTHER: Placebo,"Change in the MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore, The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a clinimetric assessment of subjective and objective symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease created by the Movement Disorder Society. MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale used in this study is Part III's tremor subscore (3.17). The subscale has a 0-4 rating, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Higher MDS-UPDRS scores reflect worse tremor/motor function. Larger differences will infer greater effect size for the intervention. Score drops over time imply improvement in tremor/motor function., Prior to onabotulinumtoxinA injection and at 30 days after injection","Change in the ARAT Score, The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an evaluated measure to assess specific changes in limb function after neurologic sequelae. It assesses a person's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation. The ARAT is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale: 3: Performs test normally 2: Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty 1: Performs test partially 0: Can perform no part of test. The maximum score on the ARAT is 57 points (possible range 0 to 57). Higher ARAT scores reflect greater preservation of function in tested arm. Larger differences will infer greater effect sizes for the intervention. Score drops over time imply worsening limb function., Prior to onabotulinumtoxinA injection and at 30 days after injection|Correlation Between MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore and Px1 Tremor Amplitude, MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales.

NCT04821830,Vigor and the LDR in Parkinson Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04821830,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a common disorder in which reduced speed of movement results from inadequate brain production of the chemical dopamine. The most effective treatment for PD is the drug levo-dopa, which partially replaces brain dopamine. Despite decades of successful use, how levo-dopa improves speed of movement in PD is not understood. This observational study recruits participants who have been prescribed levo-dopa by their treating physicians. Before their first dose, immediately after their first dose and later, when their dose has been stabilized, they will engage with the research team to participate in a few simple experiments to measure speed, grip strength, tremor, and stability (on and off of treatment). The purpose of these experiments is to understand how levo-dopa treatment in Parkinson disease enhances movement speed. An important but not understood component of levo-dopa action, the Long Duration Response (LDR), lasts for days to weeks. A basic function of dopamine signaling in the brain is modulation of motivation - the coupling between effort and action values. These experiments will determine if the LDR is associated with relative normalization of motivation function in the brain. The motivation behavior of recently diagnosed PD participants will be examined before and after treatment with levo-dopa to determine if the magnitude of the LDR is correlated with improvements in motivation behavior.",YES,Parkinson Disease,"DRUG: carbidopa/levodopa, as prescribed by treating physician","Tapping Speed Task - Experiment 1, Measurement of bradykinesia.

NCT00297778,Pramipexole Versus Placebo in Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients With Depressive Symptoms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00297778,,COMPLETED,"Parkinsons Disease (PD) is caused by a decrease of dopamine in a particular part of the brain. Dopamine is a messenger substance (neurotransmitter) that is used by the cells of the brain (nerve cells) to control and harmonize muscle movements. Consequently, the main manifestations of the disease affect movement and include tremor, muscular rigidity, slowness in performing movements and loss of balance.

However, the disease affects also other, non motor functions and may cause other disorders, such as depression. Depression may be a reaction to the disability caused by the disease, but many studies show that depression is more common in PD than in other chronic debilitating illnesses. Moreover, there is also a biological explanation for the phenomenon: dopamine is also used in brain circuits involved in the experience of pleasure, and loss of pleasure in daily physical or social activity is one of the key manifestations of depression.

The objective of the study is to assess whether pramipexole, at doses approved for the treatment of PD symptoms, is more effective than placebo in resolving depressive symptoms in PD patients.

Orthostatic hypotension has been documented as a potential side effect of levodopa. As a result, clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe levodopa in patients with PD with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (PD+OH), which leads to suboptimal management of motor symptoms. On the other hand, other studies failed to show any clear relationship between levodopa and orthostatic hypotension in patients with PD. Important limitations of prior studies include the lack of detailed investigation of baroreflex cardiovagal and sympathetic noradrenergic functions and the fact that the same patients were not tested on and off levodopa.

NCT01421719,Safety and Efficacy of botulinumA Toxin (BotoxA) for Treatment of Neurogenic Bladder of Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01421719,,COMPLETED,"The basic nerve deficit of Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to lower urinary tract symptoms of frequency, urgency and urge urinary incontinence. Lower urinary tract symptoms tend to occur at more advanced stages of PD. In the over-65 year old age group, where 1% of men suffer from this disease, they are also prone to development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and consequent associated lower urinary tract dysfunction. Similarly the over 65-year age group develop spontaneous overactive bladder up to a prevalence of 30% of both men and women. The urologic disorder is exceedingly devastating in reducing the quality of life in these individuals due to the lower urinary tract symptoms and ultimate urinary incontinence in a high proportion of patients.

While attempts at pharmacologic treatment are partially satisfactory many patients are intolerant of oral drugs.

Botulinum-A neurotoxin (BTX-A) has been shown in pilot trials to be quite effective in reducing overactive bladder symptoms and is specifically beneficial for a wide-variety of neurogenic bladder causes of over activity . The treatment procedure of injecting the detrusor muscle of the bladder with BTX-A is quite simple, does not impose significant risks to the patient, and can be performed as an office urologic procedure.

NCT04649164,Learning to PERSEVERE: Peer Mentor Support and Caregiver Education in Lewy Body Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04649164,,COMPLETED,"The investigators propose to adapt, improve, and implement a peer mentor support and caregiver education (PERSEVERE) program to improve LBD-specific caregiving mastery. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common dementia, comprising Parkinson's Disease (PD) dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. LBD causes deterioration in multiple cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric domains, leading to heavy reliance on family caregivers. Patients with LBD are at a far greater risk of hospitalizations for falls, neuro-psychiatric symptoms, and infections, which are often preventable or treatable at home if recognized. Studies cite a crucial need for education and support of LBD caregivers, who face high rates of caregiver strain and adverse outcomes. Evidence from other chronic conditions supports peer mentoring as a potentially effective intervention to provide education and social support. PERSEVERE builds on our team's ongoing work of creating and testing a peer mentoring program for homebound PD patients' caregivers that has shown promising feasibility and acceptability. In the proposed project, the investigators will convene focus groups of former mentors and mentees, along with current caregivers, to provide formative information to shape the revised PERSEVERE curriculum that will include in-person mentor training and a comprehensive mentoring handbook. The curriculum will focus on key areas of LBD caregiving mastery, including: fall prevention, infections, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, and depression), and advance directives. The investigators will enroll and train a new cohort of 36 LBD caregiver peer mentors who will be matched with 30 current LBD caregivers. Each pair will be instructed to speak on a weekly basis, using the 16-week structured curriculum as a framework. The study team will support the mentors with monthly conference calls and day-to-day availability for concerns. The investigators will assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention via online study diaries tracking the frequency, duration, and content of calls. During mentor training, the investigators will assess the change in mentors' caregiver mastery and LBD knowledge pre- and post-training.

Sensors worn on the wrist and ankle combined with a mobile application continuously record data for assessment dyskinesia. Algorithms were used to detect symptoms from the motion sensors data and calculate a severity score (0 to 1 where score 0 corresponds to no dyskinesia and score 1 corresponds to dyskinesia) every 2 minutes. Wearable data collection of dyskinesia took place during a 2-day period prior to Visit 2 (Baseline), Visit 6 (Titration) and Visit 7 (Steady state).

NCT02474329,Real-PD Trial: Development of Clinical Prognostic Models for Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02474329,,COMPLETED,"Background: Long-term management of Parkinson's disease (PD) does not reach its full potential due to lack of knowledge about disease progression. The Real-PD study aim to evaluate the feasibility and compliance of usage of wearable sensors in PD patients in real life. Moreover, an explorative analysis concerning activity level, medication intake and mood will be done.

Methods: Overall, 1000 PD patients and 250 physiotherapist will be enrolled in this observational study. Dutch PD patients will be recruited across the country and an assessment will be performed using a short version of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) protocol. Moreover, participants will wear a set of medical devices (Pebble Smartwatch, fall detector) and they will use a smartphone with The Fox Insight App (Android app), 24/7, during 13 weeks. Primary measures of interest are: 1) physical activity, falls and tremor, measured by the axial accelerometers embedded in the Pebble watch and fall detector; and 2) medication intake and mood reports measured by patients' self-report in the Android app. To measure motor impact, an assessment will be performed by physiotherapists who are all certified to perform the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).

Discussion: Management of PD patients is complex and appears to be a challenging task for health care professionals. The main reason is the lack of knowledge in the disease pattern. This issue could be solved by a long term follow-up of patients' during their everyday life, and wearable medical devices can act as a way to collect data about every day life activities. Therefore, the Real-PD study will be a first contribution in increasing the lack of knowledge in disease progression, developing a new medical decision system and improving PD patients' care.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,OTHER: Clinical assessment|DEVICE: Fox Insight self-monitoring android app and falls detector,"Parkinson's Disease Symptoms, The MDS-UPDRS is a revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). It was developed to evaluate various aspects of Parkinson's disease including non-motor and motor experiences of daily living, as well as motor complications. The MDS-UPDRS characterizes the extent and burden of disease across various populations. Here, we used data from one-point assessment (baseline). The total score used here was calculated by a sum of all scores from the 4 sub-scales (i.e. part I, up to part IV) composing the MDS-UPDRS. Total score ranges from 0 to 272. A higher score indicates higher disease severity and burden, being thus a worse outcome., Baseline|Depression Scores as a Measure of Depression Rates, The scores obtained with the Geriatric Depression Scale were analysed in order to create a percentage of probably depressed participants. The total score goes from 0 to 15. A score higher than 6 indicates higher probability of suffer from a depression., Baseline|Cognitive Impairment., Total sum score obtained with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We analyzed the full score to investigate percentage of participants with a possible cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive sum scores ranges from 0 to 30, in which a score lower or equal to 26 is considered as possible cognitive decline., Baseline|Independency Level, The total sum score obtained with the Schwab and England activities of daily living scale were analyzed to describe the functional level of the sample. The total sum scores varies from 0 to 100, in which lower scores are associated with more dependency of others to perform daily life activities., Baseline","Number of Falls Per Patient Registered by the Falls Detector., The fall event is recognized by the falls detector. Every time that the patient falls, the algorithm embedded at the falls detector recognize as a fall and record the fall event. At the end of the follow-up time, a sum of the falls event for each patient will be done., Patients will be automatically assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|Number of Mood Reports for Each Patient Measured With a Four Point Scale, The number of mood reports will be collected through the smartphone application. A four point scale (very good, good, poor and fair) will be available, and by pressing the button which correspond to how the patient feels at that moment the report can be performed. At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all the reports will be done in order to measure the number of mood reports over the follow-up time., Patients will be assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date). It is expected that the assessment (self-report) will be performed as many times as the patient wants to report how they feel or at least once a day.|Number of Medication Intake Annotations Made by Each Participant Via the Self-report App., The number of medication intake annotations made by the patients will be collected through the smartphone application. Every time that the patient take medication they must press the button reporting that they took the medication. At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all the reports will be done in order to measure the number of medication intake over the follow-up time., Baseline|Time That Each Patient Was Active During the Day, The time that the patient was active during the day is calculated automatically through the app at the smartphone. The calculation is performed by using an algorithm, which analyze the patterns of walk. This algorithm is able to predict when the patient was active in a zone above his/her usual threshold (e.g. when the patient was performing one activity that makes him/her more active than during a quiet time). At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all active hours will be done in order to measure the amount of time that the patient was active over the follow-up time., Patients will be automatically assessed continuously during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The analyses was limited to walking activities.|Level of Activity for Each Patient During the Day, The level of activity for each patient is calculated automatically through the app at the smartphone. The calculation is performed by using the data collect with the accelerometers embedded in the smartwatch. An algorithm installed in the phone, which analyze the data collected with the smartwatch, can calculate the level of activity for each patient throughout the day., Patients will be automatically assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|Scores in Autonomic Dysfunctions Measure With the Autonomic Dysfunctions Scale, The scores for autonomic dysfunctions will be obtained with the Assessment of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (SCOPA-AUT). The total sum scores ranges from 0 to 100, in which high scores are correlated with more burden of autonomic dysfunctions in Parkinson's patients., Baseline|Sleepiness Rates in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale as a Measure of Sleep Quantity., The Epworth sleepiness scale was used to rate the level of sleepiness during the day. The scale's scores are related to the usual duration of sleep at night and increase with relative sleep deprivation. Here, we used data from one-point assessment (baseline). Then, we can suggest that if the sample has high scores they will have a low sleep quantity. Total sum score ranges from 0 (no sleepiness at all) to 24 (excessive sleepiness)., Baseline",,Radboud University Medical Center,Michael J.
