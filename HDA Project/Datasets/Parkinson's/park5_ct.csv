People that have PD plus dementia are also likely to experience walking difficulties. This project will examine the impact of music and mentally singing on walking performance, with a goal of understanding what types of rhythmic cues are most helpful. Pilot work from the investigators suggests that imagined, mental singing (i.e., singing in head) while while walking helps people walk faster with greater stability, whereas walking to music also helps people walk faster but with reduced stability.

In this study, the investigators will recruit people who have PD plus dementia. The investigators will compare walking while mentally singing and walking while listening to music, using personalized cues tailored to each person's walking performance. The investigators hypothesize temporal variability of gait will be lower in the mental singing and singing conditions compared to listening to music; and that mental singing, singing, and listening to music will elicit similar improvements in stride length.",YES,Parkinson Disease|Parkinson Disease Dementia,BEHAVIORAL: Mentally Singing|BEHAVIORAL: Listening to music,"Velocity, Measured with wearable sensors by APDM Wearable Technology, Baseline|Stride Length, Measured with wearable sensors by APDM Wearable Technology, Baseline",,,Washington University School of Medicine,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,17,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,AT010753-02S1,2021-04-19,2023-05-15,2023-05-15,2020-08-19,2025-01-09,2025-01-09,"Washington University School of Medicine Program in Physical Therapy, St Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT04518917/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

NCT04117178,Monitoring Anti-Dementia Drugs by Serum Levels,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04117178,MONANTI,COMPLETED,"The main objective of the MONANTI study is twofold:

Firstly, to determine the serum concentration (SC) the anti-dementia drugs donepezil and memantine in a broadly defined clinical population of patients suffering from dementia treated with the two drugs in question. Secondly, to determine whether adjustment of treatment of anti-dementia medication based on measurements of the SC will benefit patients in terms of cognitive performance, activities of daily living (ADL), frequency and severity of side effects.

The reason for conduction of this study is that the relationship between serum-level of anti-dementia drugs, clinical efficacy, compliance and side effects has only been scarcely investigated.

Both a previously published study and a preliminary (pilot)study conducted imply that roughly 50 % of patients on donepezil have SC outside the recommended therapeutic reference range (TRR).

Thus, MONANTI will investigate if this is indeed the case in a broadly comprised population of patients with dementia treated with donepezil or memantine. In addition, MONANTI will link SC to co-morbidity, level of compliance, medication interactions. It is hypothesized that the efficacy of anti-dementia drugs can be significantly improved by adjustment of treatment according to SC. Also, it is hypothesized that the burden of side effects can be reduced in patients in whom too high SC are detected, if dose reduction or change of treatment drug is done.

MONANTI is a randomized study, in which the assessor is blinded to avoid related biases to the extent possible.

To meet the enrollment criteria eligible participants must:

A) be newly diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy-bodies or Parkinson's disease with dementia and B) be scheduled for treatment with either donepezil or memantine. C) not meet a list of (exclusion) criteria, which have been set up in order to avoid blur and biases of the results.

D) be able to give written informed consent to participation in presence of a close relative.

After enrollment the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. In the first of these, the control group, the participants receive standard treatment and follow-up at the outpatient clinic. In addition, all participants in the control group who complete the trial will have a blood sample collected at the final visit to measure the SC of the anti-dementia drug along with a genetic test for a few key genes thought to be relevant for the study (two liver enzymes (cyp2D6, cyp3A4/5, APOE-genotype, butyrylcholine-esterase K-variant).

In the other group, the intervention group, the participators will be closely monitored for side effects after prescription of anti-dementia drugs. All participants in the intervention group will be offered a measurement of the SC in case they experience drug side effects within 2 months of treatment initiation. All participants in the intervention group will have a measurement of the SC done at the 6 months visit. The measured SC will be compared to the TRR of the drug in question. This information, along with details from the clinical assessment at the 6 month visit will be used to guide the decision of whether or not to adjust treatment. All decisions on treatment adjustment during the trial are done by the PI according to details in the protocol.

All participants in the intervention group are evaluated again at a 12 month visit, identical to that of the control groups.

To assess the possible effects of SC guided treatment adjustment six clinical tests/rating scales will be used (MMSE, ACE, NPI-Q, DAD, CGI, GDS). The tests/rating scales will be administered both at the enrollement visit and one year later at the final 12 month follow-up visit.

To measure the effect of donepezil on brain cholinergic function approx. 30 participants will be recruited for electroencephalography (EEG). These participants will have an EEG done at enrollment and after 12 months.

In addition to the above mentioned quantitative study a qualitative study with relatives of enrolled participants is planned.

In this task, a small circle (target) continuously moves across the screen in a semi-randomized fashion, so as to minimize the subject's ability to predict the trajectory of the target. The subject is instructed to use his/her finger on the touch screen to move a small dot so that it is consistently within the center of the moving target on the screen. During the test, the speed of the circle is adjusted in response to the subject's ability to keep the dot in the circle, ensuring that the test is adapted to the individual subject. The outcome variable was the mean 'difficulty multiplier', which is a calculation adjustment of the participant's accuracy on target relative to current target speed, averaged over the entire testing session. The difficulty multiplier ranges from 0 to 10.

NCT04649164,Learning to PERSEVERE: Peer Mentor Support and Caregiver Education in Lewy Body Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04649164,,COMPLETED,"The investigators propose to adapt, improve, and implement a peer mentor support and caregiver education (PERSEVERE) program to improve LBD-specific caregiving mastery. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common dementia, comprising Parkinson's Disease (PD) dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. LBD causes deterioration in multiple cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric domains, leading to heavy reliance on family caregivers. Patients with LBD are at a far greater risk of hospitalizations for falls, neuro-psychiatric symptoms, and infections, which are often preventable or treatable at home if recognized. Studies cite a crucial need for education and support of LBD caregivers, who face high rates of caregiver strain and adverse outcomes. Evidence from other chronic conditions supports peer mentoring as a potentially effective intervention to provide education and social support. PERSEVERE builds on our team's ongoing work of creating and testing a peer mentoring program for homebound PD patients' caregivers that has shown promising feasibility and acceptability. In the proposed project, the investigators will convene focus groups of former mentors and mentees, along with current caregivers, to provide formative information to shape the revised PERSEVERE curriculum that will include in-person mentor training and a comprehensive mentoring handbook. The curriculum will focus on key areas of LBD caregiving mastery, including: fall prevention, infections, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, and depression), and advance directives. The investigators will enroll and train a new cohort of 36 LBD caregiver peer mentors who will be matched with 30 current LBD caregivers. Each pair will be instructed to speak on a weekly basis, using the 16-week structured curriculum as a framework. The study team will support the mentors with monthly conference calls and day-to-day availability for concerns. The investigators will assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention via online study diaries tracking the frequency, duration, and content of calls. During mentor training, the investigators will assess the change in mentors' caregiver mastery and LBD knowledge pre- and post-training.

This metric is derived from task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and represents the power of regional spontaneous and intrinsic brain activity at the local, voxel-wise level while the subject is at rest. More specifically, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is the total power in the low-frequency range, and fALFF is calculated by dividing ALFF by the total power across all measurable frequencies. Whereas ALFF values increase near blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), likely due to pulsations in those areas, fALFF is less susceptible to artifactual signals.

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.
