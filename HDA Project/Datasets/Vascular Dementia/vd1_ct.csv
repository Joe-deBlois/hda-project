NCT01965756,Effect of Insulin Sensitizer Metformin on AD Biomarkers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01965756,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, affecting approximately 18 million people worldwide, including almost 500,000 in the Philadelphia tri-state area. After age 65, the incidence of AD rises exponentially, doubling every five years. By age 85, almost half of us will have AD. In 2030, as many as 7.7 million Americans could have AD, and by 2050 this number could rise to 11-16 million people. The annual cost of AD in the United States is about $200 billion. AD-related medical complications are among the most common causes of death in the elderly population. Despite these alarming statistics, a ""cure"" for AD may not be essential since delaying the onset of AD by just 5 years could have a profound impact on this disorder by reducing the incidence and cost of AD by 50% between now and 2050.

AD is difficult to recognize in its earliest stages, in which the principal complaint is typically an increase in episodes of forgetfulness. This stage is now commonly referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers have demonstrated good accuracy in predicting which MCI patients later ""convert"" to AD and which tend to remain stable or revert to more normal cognition. The diagnosis of AD itself is made when increased loss of memory and other cognitive abilities (eg, language, praxis, and executive function) affect daily functioning. As the symptoms of dementia inevitably worsen, patients may become incapable of even basic activities such as feeding and dressing themselves. The disease course often spans more than a decade, creating a vast social and financial burden on society and extracting an immeasurable emotional toll on family members.

In addition an automated approach to fidelity monitoring using computational linguistics (automatic classification programs) will be developed. In Phase II, ten long term care community-based (PACE) organizations will be randomized into two groups; 5 PACE organizations will serve as the ""control"" site in which staff training will be provided via the traditional high intensity face-to-face training in the COPE program. 5 PACE organizations will serve as the comparison and staff will be trained using the online COPE training program. Phase II will evaluate the whether an online training program is the same or better in improving PACE staff competency and fidelity to COPE principles and protocols compared to a high intensity face-to-face traditional form of training. In Phase III the efficacy of the COPE program on PACE participant outcomes by type of COPE training will be evaluated. Each of the PACE organizations will enroll 5 persons with dementia and their caregivers in the study. This will yield 50 family dyads (25 dyads in traditional training sites and 25 dyads in online training sites). Dyads will be followed for 4 months.

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.

It is thought that small vessel stroke is caused by damage to the lining of the tiny blood vessels deep inside the brain that stops them functioning normally. This not only causes stroke but, perhaps more importantly, causes problems with thinking and walking, possibly causing up to 45% of all dementias either on its own, or mixed with Alzheimer's disease (about 350,000 patients in the UK). Some drugs that are commonly used in other blood vessel diseases may help improve small vessel function and prevent worsening of brain damage. One drug (cilostazol) has been tested in patients with stroke in the Asia Pacific countries but not on dementia; the other drug (isosorbide mononitrate) is widely used in the UK for heart disease but not stroke. The investigators want to set up a clinical trial to test if the study methods are practical so that patients and trial centres can follow the procedures, and to confirm how many patients have more stroke-like symptoms or experience worsening of their thinking skills.

NCT02033850,Rehabilitation of Attention in Patients With MCI and Brain Subcortical Vascular Changes Using the APT-II,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02033850,RehAtt,COMPLETED,"Background: Subcortical Vascular Dementia (VaD), consequent to deep brain small vessel disease (SVD), is the most frequent form of VaD. The term vascular mild cognitive impairment (VMCI) defines a transitional state between normal ageing and VaD. Attentional deficits are a common finding in patients affected by VMCI or subcortical VaD. At present, no drug treatment is available to prevent vascular dementia in patients with VMCI or to improve cognitive performances of this large group of patients. Cognitive rehabilitation is directed to achieve functional changes by reinforcing, strengthening, or reestablishing previously learned patterns of behavior, or establishing new patterns of cognitive activity or compensatory mechanisms.

A hierarchical model of attention has been used to build the Attention Process Training-II (APT-II) programme.

The APT-II programme effectiveness have been demonstrated in traumatic brain injury and post-stroke rehabilitation, but there is an increasing interest in the study of cognitive rehabilitation in pathological processes that evolve over time, such as chronic cerebrovascular diseases (CVD).

Aims: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the APT-II programme could be a useful tool in the rehabilitation of attention in individuals affected by VMCI with SVD, and if so, whether the improvement in performance is generalized to functionality in daily activities and quality of life.

Main Expected Results and Impact: Considering that the APT-II contains specific exercises to facilitate generalization to daily life, the skills that are learned by each patient during the rehabilitation programme should be generalized to daily activities.

Furthermore, the improvement of cognitive skills should also improve patient's overall quality of life because these learned skills are applicable to real-life situations. The main expected results are: 1) an impact of APT-II on disability, everyday cognition, quality of life, and performance on attention tests at short and long term after rehabilitation programme ending as compared with standard care; 2) a reduction of the risk of transition to dementia at 1 year follow-up as compared with control group.",YES,Mild Cognitive Impairment,BEHAVIORAL: Attention Process Training-II,"Functionality in Activities of Daily Living (Changes in Scores Approach), Changes in scores (Δ) approach.

Both situations lead to reduced quality of life and cardiovascular disease-a complication of uncontrolled hypertension. Maintaining the health of these caregivers is critical to support the well-being of the care recipients. Although some multi-component interventions have addressed ADRD caregiver's stress and quality of life, gaps remain in targeting interventions to address the complexity of chronic caregiving stress and hypertension self-care in African American women.

This pilot study builds on the investigator's earlier work which showed that stress, blood pressure knowledge, and complex diet information deficits all interfered with older African American women's hypertension self-care. Lifestyle changes (stress management, reducing sodium, eating fruits/vegetables, and physical activity) are effective in managing hypertension. The investigator's Stage I pilot study is based on the scientific rationale that these lifestyle changes can be promoted by addressing stress reactivity/stress resilience, the psychological and physiological response of the body to stress, as the underlying mechanism to facilitate behavioral change.

The measure will be assessed in drivers immediately following administration of control condition or intervention, Day 0 (Post-intervention)|Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 4-item Depression Score, Depression will be measured using the PROMIS Short Form 4-item scale (4a Adult v1.0), with higher PROMIS scores indicating higher depression. PROMIS scores are presented as standardized T-scores (mean=50, standard deviation=10). Lower PROMIS depression scores indicate better outcomes (lower depression).

Change in depression is calculated as the PROMIS depression score at each time point (6, 12, 18, or 24 months) minus the score at baseline (pre-randomization). Since PROMIS scores at each time point can range from 41.0 to 79.4, change in depression PROMIS scores can range from -38.4 to +38.4. Change-scores \> 0 represent increases in depression (poor outcome), and changes \<= 0 represent maintained or decreased depression (better outcome)., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Ottawa Decision Regret Score, Change in decision regret will be measured by the Ottawa Decision Regret Scale. This validated measure correlates with decision satisfaction and conflict, and overall quality of life. Scored from 0-100, high scores represent higher regret. Lower scores indicate better outcomes.

Decision regret was measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, so change in decision regret can be calculated from 12 months (vs. 6 months), 18 months (vs. 6 months), and 24 months (vs 6 months). Since decision regret scores range from 0-100, change in decision regret scores range from -100 to + 100, with change-scores \<= 0 representing maintenance or decreases in decision regret (positive outcome) and change-scores \> 0 representing increased decision regret over time (negative outcome)., 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Life Space Score, Life space is a global measure of mobility and community engagement. The Life-Space Assessment instrument (UAB Study of Aging) is a validated tool assessing recent mobility and function. Composite scores range from 0 (bedbound) to 120 (travel out of town every day without assistance); scores of ≤60 are correlated with lower levels of social participation and higher mortality. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.

Change in life space can be calculated at 6 months (vs baseline), 12 months (vs baseline), 18 months (vs baseline), and 24 months (vs baseline). Since life space scores range from 0-120, change-scores in life space can range from -120 to +120. Maintained or increased life space (change-scores \>= 0) are positive outcomes, and decreased life space (change-scores \< 0) are negative outcomes., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Self-reported Driving Frequency, Self-reported driving frequency will be measured by number of days per week participants drive, with consideration of higher or lower frequency as a positive or negative outcome in the context of participant's intent to drive with lower or higher frequency.

In the final study survey, this question was reworded, so participants were asked ""during the past 6 months, have you reduced the number of days per week you normally drive?"" with response options of ""yes"", ""no"", ""I don't know"". Percentage of those who answered ""yes"" at each time point are reported., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Self-reported Situational Driving Avoidance, Driving avoidance in certain situations will be measured by asking participants about their avoidance of riskier driving situations, e.g., nighttime driving, with consideration of avoidance in certain situations as a positive or negative outcome in the context of participant's intent to avoid these situations.

Avoidance of night driving was worded as: ""Using a scale from 1 to 7 where 1 is Not At All Comfortable and 7 is Completely Comfortable, how comfortable do you feel in the following situation?"", and the situation presented was ""Driving at night?"". Higher scores indicate greater comfort with driving at night, and lower scores represent less comfort. Therefore, change-scores can range from -6 to + 6, with change-scores \>= 0 indicate maintained or increased comfort with driving at night, and change-scores \< 0 indicate reduced comfort in driving at night., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Occurrence of Driving Cessation, Driving cessation will be measured by asking participants whether they are currently driving; all participants were currently driving at study baseline. Consideration of driving cessation as a positive or negative outcome will be determined in the context of participant's intent to engage in driving cessation. This question was worded as ""Do you currently drive?"" with response options of ""yes"" and ""no"". The numbers reported are those who said ""no"", which represents driving cessation.

The wording of this question was added to the study after an early DSMB meeting, so less data are available for it at earlier time points., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Occurrence of Self-reported Crashes, Occurrence of self-reported crashes will be measured by ≥1 crash versus no crashes, where ≥1 crash is a negative outcome., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months",,"University of Colorado, Denver",National Institute on Aging (NIA),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,529,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,19-0059|R01AG059613,2019-12-12,2023-06-23,2023-12-21,2019-10-28,2025-02-21,2025-02-21,"University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|CU Anschutz Medical Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/91/NCT04141891/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
