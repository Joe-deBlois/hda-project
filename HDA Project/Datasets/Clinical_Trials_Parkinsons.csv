NCT02610634,Visual Function During Gait in Parkinson's Disease: Impact of Cognition and Response to Visual Cues,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02610634,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with problems of gait such as veering, difficulty turning, an inability to perceive doorways or obstacles, and negotiate uneven terrain. Gait problems, especially veering, may be exacerbated by visuospatial dysfunction which predispose to falls, freezing and festination of gait. Visuospatial dysfunction is common in PD and likely involves peripheral features (e.g. contrast sensitivity) as well as central cognitive mechanisms (e.g. attention).

Central neuro-degeneration in PD, PD dementia, and dementia with Lewy Bodies may influence visual function, as impaired visual sampling has been reported in these conditions. Visual sampling is measured via saccadic (fast eye movement) activity, as saccades are the mechanisms through which people orientate and explore the environment. The use of objective devices to reliably measure saccades is important to detect disease related eye movement changes. Emerging visuomotor research has measured visual sampling in PD using devices such as electrooculography and infra-red eye tracking, revealing reduced amplitude, speed and frequency of saccades during various tasks.

Despite recent increases in visuomotor research it remains unclear how PD influences visual sampling of the environment during gait and the influence of attentional and cognitive deficits. Recent work demonstrated that people with PD sample their environment less frequently than controls, despite a slower gait. Saccadic timing was unchanged in response to environmental cues. Despite this, environmental visual cues (transverse lines on the floor) have been shown to increase the number of fixations made during gait. However the mechanisms of this response remain unclear. Cognition is likely of importance, with response potentially influenced by attentional control.

This observational study aims to examine the influence of cognition on visuomotor control during gait in PD. This aim will be achieved by observation of visual sampling under several environmental challenges (straight walk, doorways, turns, visual cue) and a dual task.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,,"Visual Sampling Parameter: Saccade Frequency During Gait, Number of fast eye movements made per second observed when walking, measured via EOG and Dikablis mobile eye-tracker.

NCT02349789,The Role of Cerebellar Hyperactivity in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02349789,,COMPLETED,"Gait and balance disturbances are one of the most incapacitating symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) (Boonstra et al. 2008). They can cause falls and are therefore associated with the negative spiral of (near) falls, fear of falling, fractures, reduced mobility and social isolation; hence, having a profound negative impact on quality of life (Lin et al. 2012). Originally, symptoms of PD were ascribed to dopamine deficiency and basal ganglia dysfunction (Wu et al. 2013). However, in the last decades it has become clear that other brain structures are also involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Snijders et al. 2011; Stefani et al. 2007). An intriguing, emerging insight is that the cerebellum may be involved in the pathophysiology of PD (Wu et al. 2013). That is, the cerebellum is hyperactive in PD patients during different motor tasks (Yu et al. 2007; Hanakawa et al. 1999; del Olmo et al. 2006). However, whether cerebellar hyperactivity is pathological or compensatory and how it affects gait and balance in PD patients remain open questions.

The caregiver was interviewed by appropriate medical staff and asked questions about the subject in the third person.The total scores for Apathy Evaluation Scale ranges from 0 (best possible outcome) to 42 (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the 8-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8), The 8-Item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8) (Peto et al, 1998) is a self-administered questionnaire that provides a reliable measure of overall health status. The PDQ-8 collects 8 items with 5 categories each (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=sometimes, 3=often, 4=always or cannot do at all). The total score was calculated by summing the scores of all applicable questions and convert the resulting sum to a summary index score between 0 and 100 by multiplying with 100/32. A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Mood / Cognition Domain of the Nonmotor Symptom Assessment Scale (NMSS), Nonmotor performance was assessed via the Nonmotor Symptom Assessment Scale (NMSS), an accepted scale that has been validated in an international study (Naidu et al, 2006; Chaudhuri et al, 2007), at the Baseline Visit as well as at the end of the Maintenance Period. The severity and frequency of the subject's nonmotor symptoms were assessed by the investigator (or designee) in the following 9 domain categories: cardiovascular, including falls; sleep/fatigue; mood/cognition; perceptual problems/hallucinations; attention/memory; gastrointestinal tract; urinary; sexual function; and miscellaneous.

Items are scored for severity (from 0 (none) to 3 (severe)) and frequency (from 1 (rarely) to 4 (very frequent )). The score was calculated as severity x frequency. The theoretical minimum is 0 (best possible outcome) and maximum total score is 360 points (worst possible outcome)., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS), The Snaith Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) (Snaith et al, 1995) is a self-report instrument developed for the assessment of hedonic capacity. The sum of the 14 items scores range from 0 to 14. A higher score represents more anhedonic symptoms., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Beck Depression Inventory Second Edition (BDI-II), The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a self-report instrument to measure depression symptoms and severity (Beck et al, 1961). The BDI-II is a revised version of the scale in order to be more consistent with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for depression (Beck et al, 1996). There are 21 items in the BDI-II, classified as cognitive-affective (Items 1-13) and somatic-performance (Items 14-21) subscales. The degree of severity is indicated on a 4-point scale; items are rated from 0 (not at all) to 3 (extreme form of each symptom). Scores of 0-13 indicate minimal depression, 14-19 indicate mild depression, 20-28 indicate moderate depression, and 29-63 indicate severe depression., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Sum Score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part III (Motor Subscale) in ""on"" State, Part III of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) assesses motor function. The UPDRS is completed by questioning the subject about his/her general state in conjunction with any observations made by the investigator (or designee) since the previous visit.

The UPDRS Part III (motor subscale) had to be measured in the ""on"" state and consisted of 27 items and sub items scored between 0 and 4. The sum score ranged between 0 and 108 and was calculated as sum of the 27 individual scores. If 1 or more items were missing and could not be substituted with a previous post-Baseline value, the sum score was also missing.

A negative value indicates an improvement., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period / Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)|Change From Baseline to the End of the Maintenance Period in the Score of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) Item I (Severity of Illness), The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scales (Guy and Bonato, 1970) were initially developed for a risk-benefit estimation within the treatment of mentally ill patients. The 4 global scales (severity of illness, change in severity from Baseline, therapeutic efficacy, and tolerability of treatment) are used as different measures of treatment outcome in different kinds of pharmacological studies.

The CGI Item 1 (severity of illness) collected 1 answer out of 8 categories (0-'Not assessed', 1-'Normal, not at all ill', 2-'Borderline ill', 3-'Mildly ill', 4-'Moderately ill', 5-'Markedly ill', 6-'Severely ill', and 7-'Among the most extremely ill patients') at each assessment. The category 0-'Not assessed' was considered as missing and therefore used neither for calculation nor for display purposes., Baseline (Visit 2) until End of the Maintenance Period/Early Withdrawal (up to 19 weeks after Baseline)",,UCB BIOSCIENCES GmbH,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,122,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",PD0005|2012-002840-26,2013-02,2014-01,2014-03,2013-02-01,2015-01-19,2018-08-31,"4320, Birmingham, Alabama, United States|4309, Oxnard, California, United States|4306, Ormond Beach, Florida, United States|4311, Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, United States|4313, Tampa, Florida, United States|4314, Decatur, Georgia, United States|4318, Chicago, Illinois, United States|4316, Winfield, Illinois, United States|4322, Des Moines, Iowa, United States|4304, Kansas City, Kansas, United States|4326, Springfield, Massachusetts, United States|4330, Ocean Springs, Mississippi, United States|4302, Las Vegas, Nevada, United States|4303, Commack, New York, United States|4317, New York, New York, United States|4323, New York, New York, United States|4319, Asheville, North Carolina, United States|4325, Charlotte, North Carolina, United States|4329, Akron, Ohio, United States|4312, Cincinnati, Ohio, United States|4324, Beaufort, South Carolina, United States|4332, Charleston, South Carolina, United States|4305, San Antonio, Texas, United States|4307, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States|4333, Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States|3001, Innsbruck, Austria|3003, Linz, Austria|3301, Budapest, Hungary|3302, Debrecen, Hungary|3509, Gdansk, Poland|3506, Gdynia, Poland|3504, Poznan, Poland|3801, Banská Bystrica, Slovakia|3805, Bratislava, Slovakia|3806, Krompachy, Slovakia|3807, Žilina, Slovakia|3901, Ljubljana, Slovenia|4001, Barcelona, Spain|4006, Barcelona, Spain|4009, Oviedo, Spain|4005, Seville, Spain|4010, Seville, Spain",
NCT01470859,The Effect of Pramipexole on Metabolic Network Activity Compared With Levodopa in Early Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01470859,,COMPLETED,"Levodopa and non-ergot dopaminergic agonists such as pramipexole are both recommended as the first-line symptomatic treatment for early untreated Parkinson's disease (PD), previous clinical trial indicated that initial pramipexole owns advantage over levodopa regarding motor complications, on the contrary, less adverse effect like freezing and severe somnolence favors initial treatment of levodopa. Thus, it remains controversial that initiation of which medication will be better for those patients with early PD.

Parkinson's disease-related spatial covariance patter (PDRP) is a new biomarker which can represent the network activity of brain and severity of PD. Based on the literatures and our previous data, the investigators hypothesize that PDRP will be served as a biomarker to help us evaluate and compare the effect of levodopa or pramipexole on the progression of PD, which might be able to provide further evidence for clinicians to address the above critical issue.",YES,Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: pramipexole|DRUG: Sinemet CR,"Longitudinal Change of Brain Network Activity, The brain network activity is evaluated by Parkinson's disease-related spatial covariance pattern(PDRP) value (Z score).

The ketogenic diet uses fats as a person's major energy source rather than carbohydrates. There is increasing interest in using this diet to treat neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Researchers want to learn more about the ketogenic diet before recommending this diet in clinical practice.

Objective:

To study the effects of a ketogenic diet for someone with PD.

Eligibility:

People over age 50 with mild to moderate PD.

Design:

Participants will be screened with surveys and a 10-foot walking test. They will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood test.

Participants will be contacted twice in a 1-week period to discuss what they ate over the last 24 hours. They will log data about their daily exercise and activities using an online fitness tracking app.

Participants will stay at NIH Clinical Center for 1 week. They will be put into 1 of 2 groups. One group will follow a ketogenic diet and take MCT oil. The other group will follow a low-fat diet. Their body measurements will be taken. They will meet with a physical therapist and nutritionist.

Participants will have daily respiratory and glucose monitoring. They will have cognitive tests and complete surveys. They will have walking, motor function, and reaction time/finger tapping tests. They will have heart and nerve function tests. They will have electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms. Blood will be taken twice daily.

Participants will follow the ketogenic diet at home for 2 weeks. They will log their activities using the fitness tracking app. Then they will have a follow-up visit at NIH.

Although current pharmacological therapies provide beneficial effects on motor symptoms of the disease (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia), intolerable disability eventually develops in most patients. A disease-modifying therapy that slows disease progression is a major unmet medical need in PD. Numerous agents have neuroprotective effects in pre-clinical laboratory models, but none have been shown to have indisputable disease-modifying effects in clinical trials for patients with PD.

The purpose of this research study is to investigate how the brain and motor behavior changes in PD over time in response to rasagiline which is a monoamine oxidase-B(MAO-B) inhibitor. The drug rasagiline will be tested in this study as the MAO-B inhibitor. Rasagiline has been prescribed for many years to treat symptomatic Parkinson's disease. It is FDA approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease but has not been shown to slow disease progression. The outcome and impact of this study will provide the first evaluation of MAO-B inhibitors at slowing the progression of the nigrostriatal pathway using advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) methods in PD.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: Rasagiline|OTHER: Placebo|DEVICE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging|DEVICE: functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging|OTHER: Physical Function Performance Test,"Change in Free-water Accumulation in the Substantia Nigra, 12-month study in PD to watch the effect of an Monoamine Oxidase-B inhibitor on the progressive increase of free-water accumulation in the substantia nigra.

Recently, free-water diffusion MRI analysis using a bi-tensor model was developed to explicitly estimate the contribution of freely diffusing water molecules within the voxel. This free-water measure is expected to increase with atrophy-based neurodegeneration.

NCT01539837,A Pilot Clinical Trial With the Iron Chelator Deferiprone in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01539837,DeferipronPD,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting movement. Although drug treatments for PD are available they only treat the symptoms of the disease, fail to halt neuronal loss, and are associated with long term side effects and loss of efficacy. There is a chronic need to develop neuroprotective therapies. Increased iron and oxidative stress have been heavily implicated in the neurodegenerative process in PD, hence removal of excess iron by iron chelation represents a potential drug target. Iron chelators are extensively utilised to treat peripheral iron overload disorders (e.g. thalassaemia) and recently the investigators have demonstrated iron chelators such as Deferiprone can enter the brain removing excess iron and are neuroprotective in PD animal models. Although good tolerability and efficacy to remove brain iron has also been shown in a pilot study with the iron chelators Deferiprone in young patients with Friedreich Ataxia, where iron accumulates in the dentate nucleus, no studies have been conducted in aged individuals affected by PD. Hence the aims of this study are 1) to assess whether Deferiprone is well tolerated in PD patients, 2) whether Deferiprone can remove the excess iron levels found in the brain area affected by PD, the substantia nigra, as assessed by Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 3) whether Deferiprone has any direct effect on the clinical symptoms of PD. Three groups of 12 (total 36) early stage drug free PD patients will be treated with 20 or 30mg/kg/d Deferiprone or Placebo for 6 months.

The safety and potential benefits of tDCS to children or adults patients who are paralyzed because of brain damage are reported in the medical literature. In addition, some patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience improvement in memory and report better use of the hand after tDCS. The treatment requires putting electrodes (pads) over the head and sending very small amount of electrical current that the patient may feel as ""little tingling"". Application of tDCS takes 20 min. In this study we wish to test if tDCS application can improve stepping and walking ability of subjects with PD and if the improvement is the same as when walking on treadmill. We plan to test the subject's ability to step when pulled by a laboratory testing system and also test his/her walking ability. There will be 3 sessions 7 days apart. In the first session the subject will be tested then treated for 20 min with tDCS and then tested again.

Currently, cDBS is limited to ""open-loop"" stimulation, without real-time adjustment to the patient's state of activity, fluctuations and types of motor symptoms, medication dosages, or neural markers of the disease. The purpose of this study is to determine if an adaptive DBS system, responding to patient specific, clinically relevant neural or kinematic feedback, is efficacious on the motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III) and specific phenotypic measures in Parkinson's Disease compared to OFF therapy (i.e., OFF DBS and withdrawn from medication) and more efficient than cDBS.

The PC+S streams off power of the local field potential signal measured from the subthalamic nucleus in a frequency band of interest within the beta band (13-30 Hz). The amplitude of the signal, beta power, was streamed from each subthalamic nucleus (STN) during the calibration period of the experiment when DBS was off (i.e., OFF therapy), when continuous DBS was set at the lower and upper stimulation voltage that were found for determining the stimulation limits of adaptive DBS, and during the 30 minutes of aDBS. We calculated the median observed beta power during aDBS. To compute normalized beta band power, the median value was divided by the observed beta power OFF therapy and during the continuous DBS at the lower and upper voltage.

NCT00640159,Selegiline to Zelapar Switch Study in Parkinson Disease Patients,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00640159,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. Symptomatic therapy is primarily aimed at restoring dopamine function in the brain. Oral selegiline in conjunction with L-dopa has been a mainstay of therapy for PD patients experiencing motor fluctuations for many years. The mechanisms accounting for selegiline's beneficial adjunctive action in the treatment of PD are not fully understood. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B (MAO-B) activity is generally considered to be of primary importance.

Oral selegiline has low bio-availability and is typically dosed BID, for a total of 5-10 mg daily. Recently, the FDA approved a new orally disintegration tablet (ODT) formulation of selegiline, called ZelaparTM. This new formulation utilizes Zydis technology to dissolve in the mouth, with absorption through the oral mucosa, thereby largely bypassing the gut and avoiding first pass hepatic metabolism. This allows more active drug to be delivered at a lower dose. Consequently, Zelapar is dosed once-daily, up to 2.5 mg per day. There are no empirical data indicating whether the use of the new approved formulation of selegiline ODT (Zelapar) is superior or preferred by patients compared to traditional oral selegiline. It is believed that clinical efficacy will be preserved or enhanced, by delivering more active drug, with improved patient preference for the ODT formulation due to the once-daily dosing .

The effectiveness of orally disintegrating selegiline as an adjunct to carbidopa/levodopa in the treatment of PD was established in a multicenter randomized placebo-controlled trial (n=140; 94 received orally disintegrating selegiline, 46 received placebo) of three months' duration. Patients randomized to orally disintegrating selegiline received a daily dose of 1.25 mg for the first 6 weeks and a daily dose of 2.5 mg for the last 6 weeks. Patients were all treated with levodopa and could additionally have been on dopamine agonists, anticholinergics, amantadine, or any combination of these during the trial. At 12 weeks, orally disintegrating selegiline-treated patients had an average of 2.2 hours per day less ""OFF"" time compared to baseline. Placebo treated patients had 0.6 hours per day less ""OFF"" time compared to baseline. These differences were significant (p \< 0.001). Adverse events were very similar between drug and placebo.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,DRUG: Zelapar,"Clinical Global Impression Scale, Baseline assessments included a clinical global impression scale.

This study is a double-blind, placebo controlled, cross-over randomized clinical trial. Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), a physiological index of cholinergic function will be measured to determine if the deficits in balance and gait correlate with abnormalities of the SAI and if SAI is altered by donepezil as a measure of drug efficacy. Cognitive tests like the Attention Network Test (ANT) will be administered to determine if changes in gait and balance are mediated by changes in attention.

The results of this study will be the most direct test of the hypothesized role of cholinergic neurons and the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine in terms of gait and balance. The study is exploratory because it is not known whether donepezil will affect gait, balance or attention, nor which measures of gait, balance or attention will be sensitive to drug manipulation. The study's immediate goal is to determine the potential utility of cholinergic manipulation as a strategy for preventing or treating balance and gait dysfunction in PD.

NCT04380142,Study Comparing Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion Of ABBV-951 With Oral Carbidopa/Levodopa Tablets For Treatment Of Motor Fluctuations In Adult Participants With Advanced Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04380142,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition, which affects the brain. PD gets worse over time, but how quickly it progresses varies a lot from person to person. Some symptoms of PD are tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. This study measures the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ABBV-951 versus oral Levodopa (LD)/Carbidopa (CD) \[LD/CD\] in advanced PD participants to achieve reduction in motor fluctuations.

ABBV-951 is an investigational (unapproved) drug containing Levodopa Phosphate/Carbidopa Phosphate (LDP/CDP) given subcutaneously (under the skin) for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. Adult participants with advanced PD will be enrolled. Approximately 130 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 80 sites across the world.

In one arm, participants will receive ABBV-951 solution as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral placebo capsules for LD/CD. In the second arm, participants will receive placebo solution for ABBV-951 as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral capsules containing LD/CD tablets. The treatment duration is 12 weeks.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.",YES,Parkinson's Disease (PD),DRUG: ABBV-951|DRUG: Placebo for Levodopa/Carbidopa (LD/CD)|DRUG: Levodopa/Carbidopa (LD/CD)|DRUG: Placebo for ABBV-951,"Change From Baseline to Week 12 of the Double-Blind Treatment Period in Average Daily Normalized ""On"" Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia, ""On"" time is defined as periods of good motor symptom control, and was assessed by the Parkinson's Disease (PD) diary.

Part 1 contains 11 questions about the ON time dyskinesia and the impact of ON-dyskinesia on experiences of daily living. Part 2 contains 4 questions about OFF-dystonia rating. Part 3 contains 7 questions about objective evaluation of dyskinesia impairment and Part 4 contains 4 questions regarding dyskinesia disability. Each question is scored with respect to severity, which is rated on a scale where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3= moderate and 4 = severe. The UDysRS total score is obtained by summing the item scores, ranging from 0 to 104. Higher scores are associated with more disability. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement., Baseline, Week 12","Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in ON Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia, The Parkinson's Disease (PD) Symptom Diary is completed every 30 minutes for the full 24 hours of each of 3 days prior to selected study visits. It reflects both time awake and time asleep. Daily totals are normalized to a 16-hour scale (i.e., 16 hours of awake time). The normalized totals for the 3 days prior to the visit are averaged for the analysis. ON time is when PD symptoms are well controlled by the drug, and OFF time is when PD symptoms are not adequately controlled by the drug. Positive change from baseline for ON time without troublesome dyskinesia indicates improvement., Baseline, Week 12|Mean Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8) Summary Index, The Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8) is a disease-specific instrument designed to measure aspects of health that are relevant to participants with PD, and which may not be included in general health status questionnaires. The PDQ-8 is a self-administered questionnaire. Each item is scored on the following 5-point scale: 0 = Never, 1 = Occasionally, 2 = Sometimes, 3 = Often, 4 = Always (or cannot do at all, if applicable). Higher scores are consistently associated with the more severe symptoms of the disease such as tremors and stiffness. The results are presented as a summary index. The PDQ-8 summary index ranges from 0 to 100, where lower scores indicate a better perceived health status. Negative changes from baseline indicate improvement., Baseline, Week 12|Mean Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) Score at Week 12, The Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C) score is a clinician's rating scale for assessing Global Improvement of Change. The CGI-C rates improvement by 7 categories: very much improved (1), much improved (2), minimally improved (3), no change (4), minimally worse (5), much worse (6), very much worse (7).

NCT01167608,Barriers to Mental Healthcare Utilization in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01167608,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly. In most people, the illness is complicated by co-occurring psychiatric problems such as depression and anxiety. These non-motor concerns negatively affect the course and management of the disease, often leading to poor outcomes for both patients and their families. Despite these deleterious consequences, psychiatric symptoms in PD are both underreported by patients as well as under-recognized and under-treated by health care providers.

The primary purpose of this study is to identify and describe barriers to mental healthcare utilization for people with Parkinson's disease. Secondary objectives include the assessment of attitudes and preferences regarding the need for mental health services in the PD community and the acceptability of telehealth interventions as a method for improving access and quality of care. In order to accomplish these aims, participants will be asked to fill out an anonymous survey which will take about 15-30 minutes to complete. To best accommodate PD patients with varying levels of disability, participants will have the option to complete the survey online, on paper, or over the phone. The information obtained from this study will be used to support future treatment development efforts (i.e., phone and internet based interventions, community based trainings with local providers) intended to improve access and quality of mental health care for people with PD.

The scores for the eight questions are added together to obtain a single number. A number in the 0-9 range is considered to be normal while a number in the 10-24 range indicates excessive daytime sleepiness. Higher scores imply worse sleepiness., Week 12 and 27|The 5-item EuroQoL (EQ-5D) Quality of Life Generic Instrument Between Groups at 12 and 27 Weeks., The EQ-5D comprises five questions on mobility, self care, pain, usual activities, and psychological status with three possible answers for each item (1=no problem, 2=moderate problem, 3=severe problem; see appendix).

NCT00856518,Expiratory Muscle Training for Persons With Neurodegenerative Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00856518,EMST,COMPLETED,"Respiratory difficulty is one of the primary factors leading to death in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple Sclerosis. Both diseases are progressive degenerating diseases that cause difficulties in breathing, airway protection and swallowing. Patients with PD and MS typically become sedentary and lose endurance, maximal fitness levels and overall pulmonary function. Much of the research focus has been on the motor symptoms of PD and MS yet the pulmonary and swallowing complications are perhaps ultimately the most important disability as the diseases progress. The inability to generate adequate respiratory pressure is responsible for reduced cough magnitudes and cough response times. Cough is critical for the clearance of foreign materials in the airway helping to reduce infiltration of bacteria and subsequent respiratory infection. With reduced cough function an increased risk for pulmonary disease occurs due to a reduced ability to protect the airways. There are a number of promising outcomes from an expiratory strength-training program. By increasing expiratory muscle strength and expiratory pressure generation, effective breathing, clearance of the airway, and improved swallowing can occur. These explicit outcomes are predicted based on our experience with the use of an innovative device-driven, home-based expiratory strength training program focused on the expiratory muscles of respiration. This project focuses on following patients with PD and MS for an initial 5 weeks of strength training and them testing the outcome of a caregiver program for maintaining treatment effects.",YES,Parkinson's Disease|Multiple Sclerosis,DEVICE: EMST|DEVICE: Sham,"Maximum Expiratory Pressure (MEP), Expiratory pressure generating capacity assessed via handheld manometer., at baseline and again after 5-week EMST exercise|Penetration-Aspiration Scale Score, The Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) was used to measure swallow safety.

The two drugs work in two different mechanisms that help each other, so there is a reason to believe that their combined activity will be better than each individual drug, and that lower doses can be used without losing the therapeutic effect. Thus, the development of P2B001 is intended to provide a combination of low doses of these two drugs, in an improved formulation, that is hoped to be more effective in controlling Parkinson's disease symptoms and with less side effects than each of the drugs taken alone or the current available commercial drugs taken together. In a previously completed clinical trial a significant improvement in Parkinson's disease symptoms was seen in patients treated with P2B001 compared to patients that were treated with placebo.

In this phase 3 study , the safety and efficacy of P2B001 will be assessed by comparing P2B001 to its individual components pramipexole and rasagiline. This will be done by monitoring the motor and non-motor symptoms, evaluating responses participants provide on questionnaires relating to Parkinson's disease and quality of life that will be completed on every visit.

Current medicines for PD only improve symptoms, treatments that slow disease progression are needed, and earlier diagnosis of PD may be the key to their development. PD symptoms can be mimicked by medicines (most commonly antipsychotic drugs that block dopamine), and some of these patients actually have underlying ""prodromal"" PD that was ""unmasked"" years before it would have caused symptoms. This problem is increasing as these medicines are now used for common conditions including post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. The investigators will identify prodromal PD in patients with drug-induced symptoms using brain scans. These patients will be enrolled in a randomized clinical trial of aerobic exercise which slows progression in animal models of PD and has other health benefits.

Participants are ranked ""O"" at baseline. The CGI-I ranks 0 - 7, with ""0"" being much improved, ""4"" being neutral, and ""7"" being much worse., Six months|Change in the Score of the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 From Baseline to Endpoint at 6 Months, The 39 question Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) is a widely used patient reported rating scale in Parkinson's disease. Respondents affirm if they have experienced problems due to their disease using a five point scale from never (0 points) to always (4 points, or worse) in doing common activities. The PDQ-39 is comprised of 8 domains: mobility, emotion, activities of daily living, cognition, stigma, social support, communication, bodily discomfort. Total possible range of scores = 0 - 156

The questions are divided into eight measurement scales each comprising 3 to 10 questions. The scores for the questions in each scale are totaled and normalized to a scale of 0 - 100, that is equivalent to percent of maximum score. The scales are; Mobility (MOB): Q1-10; Activities of Daily Life (ADL): Q11-16; Emotional Well Being (EMO): Q17-22; Stigma (STI): Q23-26; Social Support (SOC): Q27-29; Cognitions (COG): Q30-33; Communication (COM) Q34-36; and Bodily Discomfort (BOD): Q37-39., Six months|Change in the Score of the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale-Disturbed Sleep, From Baseline to Endpoint at 6 Months., The Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale 2 (PDSS-2) is designed to assess nocturnal disability in Parkinson's disease. The PDSS-2 is a 15 question analog scale that ranks answers from 0 - 4, with 4 being worse. In addition to an overall assessment of sleep disability three aspects of sleep problems can be obtained; disturbed sleep (total of questions 1-3, 8 and 14), PD-specific nocturnal motor symptoms (total of questions 4-6, 12 and 13), and PD-specific nocturnal symptoms (Total of questions 7, 9-11 and 15). We selected the ""Disturbed Sleep"" subscale as a key secondary outcome measure. This subscale has a total range of 0 - 16, with 16 being more severe., Six months|Change in the Score of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale From Baseline to Endpoint at 6 Months., The Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a scale intended to measure daytime sleepiness to help in diagnosing sleep disorders. The ESS questionnaire asks the subject to rate his or her probability of falling asleep on a scale of increasing probability from 0 (none) to 3 (worse) for eight different everyday situations. The total range is 0 - 24, with higher scores representing worse severity., Six months",,"PhotoPharmics, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,92,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",CT1301,2014-06,2016-10,2016-12-23,2014-06-26,2018-10-23,2018-10-23,"Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), Boston, Massachusetts, 02114, United States|Aspen Clinical Research, Orem, Utah, 84058, United States|VU University Medical Center (VUmc), Amsterdam, MB, 1007, Netherlands",

Balance exercises such as tai chi and yoga, along with resistance training, can improve or maintain physical function in older adults and enhance muscle strength. Furthermore, aerobic activity is critical for maintaining and improving cardiovascular and functional health. Non-contact boxing has recently seen a surge in popularity among individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD), with components of both aerobic and balance exercise. While participants anecdotally note improvements in stress and physical function, this has only been minimally studied. Therefore, we conducted a 10-week long pilot study of a structured karate exercise program. Among 15 participants, our pilot data highlights improvements in quality of life and high enthusiasm for the karate classes. Based on these promising results from the pilot, we are recruiting a larger, randomized group for the second phase of the karate intervention. The aim of this study is to test whether and to what degree a community-based karate class tailored for individuals with early- to middle-stage Parkinson's Disease (PD) 1) is feasible; 2) improves objective outcomes such as mobility and balance; 3) improves patient-reported outcomes compared with individuals given a standard exercise prescription for PD.",YES,Parkinson Disease,BEHAVIORAL: Karate Classes|BEHAVIORAL: Pre-Intervention Study Visit|BEHAVIORAL: Bimonthly Online Survey|BEHAVIORAL: 6-month Study Visit|BEHAVIORAL: 12-month Study Visit,"Change in Mobility as Measured by the Timed Up & Go (TUG), The Timed Up \& Go (TUG) is a well-validated, brief measure of mobility.

Patients without Week-8 score were counted as nonresponders., From baseline to Week 8|Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized measure of health status. The questionnaire consists of 2 components: the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system and the EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS). The descriptive system consists of 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression). Each dimension has 5 levels (from 1=no problem to 5=extreme Problems). The digits for the 5 dimensions are combined into a 5-digit code that describes the patient's health state, which is then converted into a single summary index value. Health state index scores generally range from less than 0 (where 0 is the value of a health state equivalent to dead; negative values representing values as worse than dead) to 1 (the value of full health), with higher scores indicating higher health utility.

The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the patient's health on a vertical visual analogue scale, ranging from 100 (=the best health you can imagine) to 0 (=the worst health you can imagine)., From baseline to Week 8",,ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,47,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,ACP-103-048,2018-03-09,2019-07-09,2019-07-24,2018-03-29,2020-08-31,2020-08-31,"ATP Clinical Research, Inc., Costa Mesa, California, 92626, United States|The Parkinson's and Movement Disorder Institute, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|SC3 Research-Reseda, Pasadena, California, 91105, United States|The Neurology Group, Pomona, California, 91767, United States|SC3 Research-Reseda, Reseda, California, 91335, United States|CNS Network, Torrance, California, 90502, United States|Associated Neurologists, P.C., Danbury, Connecticut, 06810, United States|Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorder Center of Boca Raton, Boca Raton, Florida, 33486, United States|University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida, 32607, United States|Parkinson's Disease Treatment Center of SW Florida, Port Charlotte, Florida, 33980, United States|Infinity Clinical Research, LLC, Sunrise, Florida, 33351, United States|Tallahassee Neurological Clinic, P.A., Tallahassee, Florida, 32308, United States|SRI Biosciences, Clinical Trials and Strategic Development Services, Plymouth, Michigan, 48170, United States|Washington University School of medicine, St Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Bio Behavioral Health, Toms River, New Jersey, 08755, United States|Albany Medical College, Albany, New York, 12208, United States|David L.

Balance exercises such as tai chi and yoga, along with resistance training, can improve or maintain physical function in older adults and enhance muscle strength. Furthermore, aerobic activity is critical for maintaining and improving cardiovascular and functional health. Noncontact boxing has recently seen a surge in popularity among individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD), with components of both aerobic and balance exercise. While participants anecdotally note improvements in stress and physical function, this has only been minimally studied. However, drawing on this experience and the combined aerobic, balance, and mindfulness practices that comprise karate, we hypothesize that participation in structured karate programs may offer similar or greater benefits.

Gait problems include decreased velocity, decreased stride length, difficulty with initiation of gait, postural stability problems and alteration in joint kinematics.1 In this typically older patient population, these gait deviations affect their participation in household and community activities. The standard of care is currently focused on therapeutic exercise and cueing of various types (visual, auditory, verbal). Current interventions have not been demonstrated to markedly improve gait kinematics, so there is a need to identify interventions that could improve gait performance in this population. Lower extremity bracing is a common and well-established intervention for gait dysfunction with other populations, including stroke and brain injury. The braces allow for improved stability, sensory feedback, and consistent tactile cues to allow patients to have the best gait mechanics with each step. It is reasonable to hypothesize that appropriate bracing may have the potential to improve gait function and kinematics in PD since these patient often have gastroc-soleus weakness. Data from our early pilot studies indicates that bracing individuals with PD can positively impact their mobility. This includes improvements in velocity, step length, and dynamic balance.

In addition, a clinical assessment battery, including quantitative tests of motor function, will be performed to investigate potential associations between the NAC intervention, brain GSH levels, oxidative stress markers, and clinical presentation. If successful, this study will represent the first objective documentation of whether there is a GSH deficit in living PD brain that dietary NAC supplementation can mitigate, thereby providing a compelling justification for investigating such neuroprotective strategies in larger controlled clinical trials.",YES,Parkinson Disease,DRUG: N-acetylcysteine|DRUG: Placebo,"Change of Cerebral Glutathione Levels as Measured by Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, In vivo brain GSH measured with 1H MRS in the unmedicated patients with idiopathic PD and in sex- and age-matched healthy controls prior to and following 4 weeks supplementation with either placebo, 1800mg/day or 3600 mg/day of NAC.

The area under the GSH spectral peak was obtained by frequency-domain fitting of the GSH resonance in the edited spectrum to a pseudo-Voigt lineshape function using a robust and highly optimized public-domain Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares minimization routine. The resulting peak areas were then expressed as ratios relative to the synchronously acquired and similarly fitted unsuppressed voxel water signal., at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention start","Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Parts I-V (Total Score Reported), The UPDRS is considered the gold standard for determining disease severity and progression in patients with Parkinson's disease. It consists of the following five elements:

1. Evaluation of mentation, behavior and mood.
2. Self evaluation of the activities of daily living (ADLs) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, etc.
3. Motor evaluation by a clinician.
4. Hoehn and Yahr scale (Hoehn 1967) for the description of the overall disease severity in PD with 8 stages.
5. Schwab and England activities of daily living scale (Schwab and England 1969) for the estimation of the general abilities in PD patients. The Schwab and England ADL scale is graduated in 10% steps with 100% indicating complete independence and 0% indicating an individual in whom the vegetative functions are completely impaired.

A total of 199 points are possible for UPDRS, with 199 representing the worst disability and 0 no disability., at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention start|Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), The MMSE is a brief questionnaire-based test that is used to screen for cognitive impairment. Domains tested are orientation to time and place, registration, attention and calculation, recall, language, repetition and complex commands. Scores lower than 25/30 points indicate mild (21-24 points), moderate (10-20 points) or severe (\<10 points) cognitive impairment, but scores may need to be corrected for educational attainment, age and interfering impairments such as motor deficits that affect drawing skills., at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention start|Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) is a 21-item instrument designed to measure the severity of illness in adults already diagnosed as having depression. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) has proven useful for many years as a way of determining a patient's level of depression before, during, and after treatment. It is clinician-administered and requires 15 to 20 minutes complete the interview and score the results. Although the HAM-D form lists 21 items, the scoring is based on the first 17. Eight items are scored on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = not present to 4 = severe. Nine are scored from 0-2.

The minimum score is 0 and maximum score is 50. The scale has been widely used in clinical practice and become a standard in pharmaceutical trials.

HAM-D Scoring Instructions are following:

0-7 = Normal; 8-13 = Mild Depression; 14-18 = Moderate Depression; 19-22 = Severe Depression;

≥ 23 = Very Severe Depression., at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention start|9-Hole Peg Board Test (9-HPT), The 9-HPT is a standardized, quantitative timed test of upper extremity motor function. Individuals are asked to place and remove nine pegs, one at a time, from nine holes in a board as quickly as possible. The task is performed twice with the dominant and twice with the non-dominant hand, and the average time to complete the task once is calculated for each hand. The 9-HPT has a high inter- and intra-rater reliability, is validated and is sensitive to detect minor impairments of hand function., at baseline and 4 weeks after intervention start|10-Meter Walk Test, The 10-meter walk test is a standardized, quantitative timed test of lower body motor function. The maximal gait speed is measured during a 10-meter walk. The task will be performed three times and the average time to complete the task once will be recorded. The 10-meter walk test is a reliable and sensitive measure of gait function in elderly individuals and PD patients.

NCT00784563,Effects of Aerobic Exercise in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00784563,,COMPLETED,"Motivated by reported improvements in aerobic fitness and executive functions after a 6-month aerobic walking intervention in normal sedentary elderly, we conducted a Phase I/II study to investigate effects of aerobic exercise on motor function, cognition, and quality of life in mild-moderate patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). To identify the best method to deliver fitness training, we also aimed to compare safety, tolerability, and fitness benefits between different training methods (continuous/moderate intensity vs. interval/alternating between low and vigorous intensity) and exercise settings (individual vs. group). Interval training reportedly facilitates higher fitness gains than continuous training. Group training may promote success through social interaction, whereas individual training offers greater flexibility.

NCT04046055,Cerebellar Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04046055,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder and affects approximately 1 million people in the United States with total annual costs approaching 11 billion dollars. The most common symptoms of PD are tremor, stiffness, slowness, and trouble with balance/walking, which lead to severe impairments in performing activities of daily living. Current medical and surgical treatments for PD are either only mildly effective, expensive, or associated with a variety of side-effects. Therefore, the development of practical and effective add-ons to current therapeutic treatment approaches would have many benefits. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that can affect brain activity and can help make long-term brain changes to improve functions like walking and balance. While a few initial research studies and review articles involving tDCS have concluded that tDCS may improve PD walking and balance, many results are not meaningful in real life and several crucial issues still prevent tDCS from being a useful add-on intervention in PD. These include the selection of stimulation sites (brain regions stimulated) and tDCS electrode placement. Most studies have targeted the motor cortex (brain region that controls intentional movement), but there is evidence that the cerebellum - which helps control gait and balance, is connected to several other brain areas, and is easily stimulated with tDCS - may be a likely location to further optimize walking and balance in PD. There is also evidence that certain electrodes placements may be better than others. Thus, the purpose of this study is to determine the effects of cerebellar tDCS stimulation using two different placement strategies on walking and balance in PD.

Additionally, although many tDCS devices are capable of a range of stimulation intensities (for example, 0 mA - 5 mA), the intensities currently used in most tDCS research are less than 2 mA, which is sufficient to produce measurable improvements; but, these improvements may be expanded at higher intensities. In the beginning, when the safety of tDCS was still being established for human subjects, careful and moderate stimulation approaches were warranted. However, recent work using stimulation at higher intensities (for example, up to 4 mA) have been performed in different people and were found to have no additional negative side-effects. Now that the safety of tDCS at higher intensities is better established, studies exploring the differences in performance between moderate (i.e., 2 mA) and higher (i.e., 4 mA) intensities are necessary to determine if increasing the intensity increases the effectiveness of the desired outcome.

Prospective participants will include 10 people with mild-moderate PD that will be recruited to complete five randomly-ordered stimulation sessions, separated by at least 5 days each. Each session will involve one visit to the Integrative Neurophysiology Laboratory (INPL) and will last for approximately one hour. Data collection is expected to take 4-6 months. Each session will include walking and balance testing performed while wearing the tDCS device.

The participant's score is calculated as a sum of the scores of the 17 individual questions. This sum score ranges from 0 to 108. Higher scores denote greater disability.

A participant has been considered ""OFF"" when he/she has been off L-dopa for greater than 12 hours. During ""OFF"" time, the participant will not report feeling the effects of their anti-Parkinson's medication. The participant recorded the exact time of L-dopa intake. Assessment was only conducted greater than 12 hours after dosing with the participant reportedly feeling ""OFF."", From Baseline (Week 0) to end of Maintenance Period (up to 54 weeks)|Change in the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) Total Score From Baseline to the End of the Double-Blind Maintenance Period, The NMSS is a 30-item rater-based scale to assess a wide range of non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. The NMSS measures severity and frequency of non-motor symptoms across nine dimensions (cardiovascular, sleep/fatigue, mood/apathy, perceptual problems/hallucinations, attention/memory, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual function, and miscellaneous which includes pain, taste/smell, weight change, and excessive sweating). Higher scores indicate a higher burden of these symptoms on the patient.

There are 30 items to be scored, and the item scores are calculated as the product of severity and frequency; the total score is obtained by summing the item scores. The NMSS total score ranges from 0 to 360 with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms; a negative change from baseline indicates improvement in symptoms., From Baseline (Week 0) to the End of Maintenance Period (up to Week 54)|Change in the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS-2) From Baseline to the End of Double-Blind Maintenance Period, The DRS-2 assesses individuals in five areas resulting in five sub-scale scores.

NCT00753519,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Treat Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00753519,,COMPLETED,"This study will look at the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on symptoms of Parkinson's disease. TMS is a method of brain stimulation that may be able to change the activity of the nerve cells of the brain. This study will examine the effects of a specific pattern of stimulation called intermittent theta-burst TMS (iTBS), which uses repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts.

People with mild to moderately severe Parkinson's disease who are between 40 and 80 years of age and whose main problems are slow movement and stiffness may be eligible for this study.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Random assignment to real or placebo (sham) iTBS treatment.
* iTBS sessions (real or sham) 4 times a week for 2 consecutive weeks. For this test, the subject sits in a comfortable chair. A wire coil is held on the subject's scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg.
* Test of gait (walk), hand and arm movements before and after each session. The gait test requires walking 10 meters (about 30 yards) in the same corridor with the same shoes.
* Extended testing. The first and last gait tests (done before starting iTBS and after the eighth session) require coming off any Parkinson's medication for at least 12 hours before the test. On these test days, subjects also undergo a clinical examination, short neuropsychological test battery, a computer-based reaction time test and depression and quality-of-life rating scales. These procedures are repeated in a follow-up visit 1 month after the last session.",YES,Parkinson Disease,DEVICE: Real iTBS|DEVICE: Sham iTBS,"Gait Speed, Gait speed was assessed by measuring the time it takes to walk 10 meters. Subject's gait speed was measured while on medication and off medication for each group, i.e., real iTBS and sham iTBS. Two trials were averaged for each condition. Patients were instructed to walk fast without taking the risk of falling, wearing the same shoes and consistently using assistive devices if needed. Gait speed was measured at baseline, 1 day post intervention, and 1 month post intervention., baseline, 1 day post iTBS","Bradykinesia, Bradykinesia refers to the slowness in executing a movement. Bradykinesia was assessed by measuring the time in seconds it takes to do the following sequence, 10 times: 1) hand closing and opening while squeezing a ball 2) elbow flexion 3) hand closing and opening, and 4) elbow extension. Subjects were allowed to practice these hand and arm movements until performance appeared not to get faster, and then were abstained from further practice to minimize learning effects. The time it takes subjects to execute the entire sequence 10 times with either the left or right arm/hand was measured. Means are reported for each group., baseline, 1 day post iTBS|Total UPDRS Score, The Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an overall assessment scale that quantifies the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Lower urinary tract symptoms tend to occur at more advanced stages of PD. In the over-65 year old age group, where 1% of men suffer from this disease, they are also prone to development of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and consequent associated lower urinary tract dysfunction. Similarly the over 65-year age group develop spontaneous overactive bladder up to a prevalence of 30% of both men and women. The urologic disorder is exceedingly devastating in reducing the quality of life in these individuals due to the lower urinary tract symptoms and ultimate urinary incontinence in a high proportion of patients.

While attempts at pharmacologic treatment are partially satisfactory many patients are intolerant of oral drugs.

Botulinum-A neurotoxin (BTX-A) has been shown in pilot trials to be quite effective in reducing overactive bladder symptoms and is specifically beneficial for a wide-variety of neurogenic bladder causes of over activity . The treatment procedure of injecting the detrusor muscle of the bladder with BTX-A is quite simple, does not impose significant risks to the patient, and can be performed as an office urologic procedure.

NCT01768832,Exercise and Parkinson's: Comparing Interventions and Exploring Neural Mechanisms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01768832,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by substantial disability and reduced quality of life, both of which can be attributed in large part to difficulties with walking. Evidence suggests that exercise may be an important addition to traditional treatments, particularly with respect to addressing walking problems. In particular, dance and treadmill training have been individually shown to improve walking performance and quality of life. At present it is not clear whether dance or treadmill training have similar effects or if one is superior to the other. Furthermore, our understanding of the means by which these exercise interventions convey benefits is extremely limited. This study aims to address these knowledge gaps by directly comparing dance, treadmill training and stretching (control group). The primary area of interest is the effects on gait, with secondary measures of disease severity, balance, and quality of life. The investigators will determine not only the effects of the interventions on walking performance, but will also investigate the effects of the interventions on connections between different parts of the brain and on brain function during imagined walking tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants will be randomly assigned to dance, treadmill training, or a stretching/flexibility control group. Participants will be assessed over a period of 6 months at 3 different time points. The investigators hypothesize that both dance and treadmill training will lead to improvements in forward walking, but that dance will result in greater improvements in backward walking compared to treadmill training. Furthermore, the investigators hypothesize that the tango and treadmill interventions will have different effects of brain function and brain connections.

Orthostatic hypotension has been documented as a potential side effect of levodopa. As a result, clinicians may be reluctant to prescribe levodopa in patients with PD with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (PD+OH), which leads to suboptimal management of motor symptoms. On the other hand, other studies failed to show any clear relationship between levodopa and orthostatic hypotension in patients with PD. Important limitations of prior studies include the lack of detailed investigation of baroreflex cardiovagal and sympathetic noradrenergic functions and the fact that the same patients were not tested on and off levodopa.

NCT03301272,Effectiveness of Botox on Reducing Rest Tremor in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03301272,,COMPLETED,"Purpose: Rest tremor in Parkinson's disease is notoriously difficult to treat through pharmacological measures, currently only predictably attenuated by the invasive deep brain stimulation surgery. The investigators hope to find some predictable and clinically meaningful attenuation of tremor with targeted use of onabotulinum toxin on muscles involved in creating the tremor.

Participants: 16 subjects who meet United Kingdom (UK) brain bank criteria for Parkinson's disease with medically refractory rest tremor of at least 3 cm amplitude.

Procedures (methods): Subjects will be blinded to receive either sham saline injection versus onabotulinum toxin injections directed to muscle groups felt to be clinically involved in causing the oscillatory movement of the tremor. Assessment of tremor severity and functional improvement from baseline after injection will occur within group (i.e. each subject will serve as their own control).

Hypotheses:

1\. (A) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly attenuates the amplitude of medically-refractory rest tremor of the upper limb in Parkinson's patients as compared to sham injections; as measured by reduction in the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) tremor subscore.

1\. (B) Onabotulinumtoxin A significantly improves the limb function of Parkinson's patients with medically-refractory rest tremor of the upper limb as compared to sham injections; as measured by an increase in Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores.",YES,Parkinson Disease,DRUG: Onabotulinumtoxin A Injection|OTHER: Placebo,"Change in the MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore, The Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is a clinimetric assessment of subjective and objective symptoms and signs of Parkinson's disease created by the Movement Disorder Society. MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales. The subscale used in this study is Part III's tremor subscore (3.17). The subscale has a 0-4 rating, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. Higher MDS-UPDRS scores reflect worse tremor/motor function. Larger differences will infer greater effect size for the intervention. Score drops over time imply improvement in tremor/motor function., Prior to onabotulinumtoxinA injection and at 30 days after injection","Change in the ARAT Score, The Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) is an evaluated measure to assess specific changes in limb function after neurologic sequelae. It assesses a person's ability to handle objects differing in size, weight and shape and therefore can be considered to be an arm-specific measure of activity limitation. The ARAT is a 19 item measure divided into 4 sub-tests (grasp, grip, pinch, and gross arm movement). Performance on each item is rated on a 4-point ordinal scale: 3: Performs test normally 2: Completes test, but takes abnormally long or has great difficulty 1: Performs test partially 0: Can perform no part of test. The maximum score on the ARAT is 57 points (possible range 0 to 57). Higher ARAT scores reflect greater preservation of function in tested arm. Larger differences will infer greater effect sizes for the intervention. Score drops over time imply worsening limb function., Prior to onabotulinumtoxinA injection and at 30 days after injection|Correlation Between MDS-UPDRS Tremor Subscore and Px1 Tremor Amplitude, MDS-UPDRS retains the four-scale structure with a reorganization of the various subscales.

This pathology affects the dopaminergic pathway but also other systems: cholinergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic.

The symptoms of Parkinson's disease are motor but also non-motor with sleep, smell, cognitive, psychiatric, digestive, urinary, dysautonomic, painful disorders. The discomfort can be such that invasive and expensive solutions have been developed. Invasive or expensive techniques (deep brain stimulation, lesional microsurgery by gamma knife or ultrasound, duodopa or apokinon pumps) brought significant benefits to patients. Opportunities for clinical improvement using less expensive and lighter devices should be sought.

The Remedee endorphin band device is a device that emits millimeter-band electromagnetic waves on the wrist. The device stimulates subcutaneous nerve endings and activates a physiological response leading to the release of endorphins in the brain. Endorphins are involved in several physiological processes, including pain control.

Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists do not only relieve pain, but have effects related to mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways.

NCT00297778,Pramipexole Versus Placebo in Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients With Depressive Symptoms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00297778,,COMPLETED,"Parkinsons Disease (PD) is caused by a decrease of dopamine in a particular part of the brain. Dopamine is a messenger substance (neurotransmitter) that is used by the cells of the brain (nerve cells) to control and harmonize muscle movements. Consequently, the main manifestations of the disease affect movement and include tremor, muscular rigidity, slowness in performing movements and loss of balance.

However, the disease affects also other, non motor functions and may cause other disorders, such as depression. Depression may be a reaction to the disability caused by the disease, but many studies show that depression is more common in PD than in other chronic debilitating illnesses. Moreover, there is also a biological explanation for the phenomenon: dopamine is also used in brain circuits involved in the experience of pleasure, and loss of pleasure in daily physical or social activity is one of the key manifestations of depression.

NCT00977184,50 Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00977184,,COMPLETED,"Background:

* In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a device creates a short-lasting magnetic field which induces an electric current in the brain leading to a change in the activity of brain cells. There are different effects on the brain with different rates of stimulation. In a previous study in people with Parkinson's disease, repetitive TMS (rTMS) given at a particular rate temporarily improved their ability to walk. A faster rate of rTMS may be more effective in treating symptoms than the rate originally used.
* This study will compare active rTMS to inactive (sham or Placebo) rTMS. Half of the people in this study will have active rTMS; the other half will have no brain stimulation with rTMS.

Objectives:

\- To see if a faster rate of transcranial magnetic stimulation is a more effective treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease than the slower rates that have been studied.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 40 and 80 years of age who have been diagnosed with mild or moderate Parkinson's disease.
* Participants must currently be taking Sinemet or dopamine agonists drugs (e.g., bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, apomorophine, and rotigotine), and are willing to continue their same treatments for the duration of the study.

Design:

* This study requires 11 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over 6 weeks. Participants can also be admitted and stay as an inpatient in the NIH Clinical Center for the entire study period (for the 10 visits during the first weeks and the follow-up visit a month later).
* Initial visit will consist of a physical examination; a test of participants' time to walk 10 meters; and questions about memory, mood, and quality of life. Participants should not take Parkinson's disease medications for 12 hours before this visit; once the examinations and tests are complete, participants will be able to take the medications. Researchers will repeat the tests 1 hour after participants take the medication.
* TMS sessions: 8 TMS sessions (4 sessions per week) over 2 weeks. Each stimulation session will last half an hour. Half of the participants will receive active TMS; the other half will receive sham TMS.
* The first 10 participants will have additional tests to study the safety of rapid TMS in patients with Parkinson's disease.
* A day after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication as in the first assessment and respond to questions about mood, memory, and quality of life.
* One month after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication.",YES,Parkinson Disease,PROCEDURE: 50 HZ Repetitive TMS|PROCEDURE: Sham rTMS,"Gait Speed, Gait speed was assessed by measuring the time it takes to walk 10 meters.

More specifically, the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) is the total power in the low-frequency range, and fALFF is calculated by dividing ALFF by the total power across all measurable frequencies.

This project will examine the impact of music and mentally singing on walking performance, with a goal of understanding what types of rhythmic cues are most helpful. Our pilot work suggests that imagined, mental singing (i.e., singing in your head) while while walking helps people walk faster with greater stability, whereas walking to music also helps people walk faster but with reduced stability.

In Aim 1, the investigators will compare walking while mentally singing to walking while listening to music, using personalized cues tailored to each person's walking performance. The investigators hypothesize stride time variability will be less in the mental singing condition compared to listening to music; and that mental singing and listening to music will improve gait speed similarly as compared to the uncued condition. The investigators will also test whether finger tapping, a rhythmic task similar to walking in many ways, responds similarly while mentally singing and listening to music.

In Aim 2, the investigator will investigate the brain mechanisms underlying the enhancements in movement performance seen with mental signing or listening to music. The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain activity during finger tapping with and without various cues to understand which areas of the brain are more or less responsive to the cues. The investigators hypothesize individuals with PD will exhibit lesser activation of putamen and greater activation of cortical motor areas and cerebellum compared to controls in all tapping conditions; and internal, mental singing during tapping will elicit greater activation of the putamen and lesser activation of cortical motor areas in both groups compared to uncued tapping and tapping while listening to music.",YES,Parkinson Disease,BEHAVIORAL: Mentally singing|BEHAVIORAL: Listening to music,"Gait Speed, Measured with wearable sensors by APDM Wearable Technology, Baseline|Stride Length Variability, Measured with wearable sensors by APDM Wearable Technology, Baseline","Brain Activity (BOLD Signal), We analyzed the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) signal in the brain to determine where there were areas of significant changes in brain activity, relative to rest, when participants were moving with no cue (uncued), moving to the beat during self cueing (mental singing) and moving to the best during external cueing (music).

The clinicopathological studies had demonstrated a 76% accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of PD.

At the beginning of PD is difficult for the clinician to distinguish from Parkinsonism Plus Syndromes (PPS) due to the similarity of symptoms and the lack of specific diagnostic tests.

Specific biomarkers to help improve the accuracy of diagnosis and to separate these two entities are highly needed

The histological hallmark for definite diagnosis of PD is the presence of fibrillar aggregates of phosphorylated alpha-synuclein called Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites. Previous autopsy-based studies have revealed that alpha-synuclein is deposited in the peripheral autonomic nervous system including the enteric nervous system of the alimentary tract, cardiac plexus, adrenal medulla and skin.

For this reason, in patients with parkinsonism, an alternative tool could be to demonstrate alpha-synuclein fibrillar aggregates in the skin, allowing early and appropriate diagnosis.",YES,Parkinson Disease|Parkinsonian Disorders,PROCEDURE: Biopsy of skin,"Demonstrate the Presence of Alpha-Synuclein Inclusions in the Skin of Parkinson's Disease and Compare With an Atypical Parkinsonism Group and With a Healthy Control Group., The presence in the brain of a-synuclein containing Lewy neurites, or bodies, is the histological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD).

The discovery of alpha-synuclein aggregates in nerve endings of the heart, digestive tract, and skin has lent support to the concept of PD as a systemic disease.

People that have PD plus dementia are also likely to experience walking difficulties. This project will examine the impact of music and mentally singing on walking performance, with a goal of understanding what types of rhythmic cues are most helpful. Pilot work from the investigators suggests that imagined, mental singing (i.e., singing in head) while while walking helps people walk faster with greater stability, whereas walking to music also helps people walk faster but with reduced stability.

In this study, the investigators will recruit people who have PD plus dementia. The investigators will compare walking while mentally singing and walking while listening to music, using personalized cues tailored to each person's walking performance. The investigators hypothesize temporal variability of gait will be lower in the mental singing and singing conditions compared to listening to music; and that mental singing, singing, and listening to music will elicit similar improvements in stride length.",YES,Parkinson Disease|Parkinson Disease Dementia,BEHAVIORAL: Mentally Singing|BEHAVIORAL: Listening to music,"Velocity, Measured with wearable sensors by APDM Wearable Technology, Baseline|Stride Length, Measured with wearable sensors by APDM Wearable Technology, Baseline",,,Washington University School of Medicine,,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,17,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,AT010753-02S1,2021-04-19,2023-05-15,2023-05-15,2020-08-19,2025-01-09,2025-01-09,"Washington University School of Medicine Program in Physical Therapy, St Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT04518917/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

The performance score on these tests is the time to complete the motor tasks. Shorter time indicates better performance. The motor function tests measure movement speed. Timed up and go test measures (seconds) how fast one can stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn, walk back to the chair and sit down again. Five times sit-to-stand test measures (seconds) how fast one can stand up from a chair with arms crossed across the chest and sit back again 5 times in a row. 360-degree turn test measures (seconds) how fast one can turn around their own axis clockwise and counterclockwise.

* Continuity of Attention: Min: - 20 # ; 35 #
* Reaction Time Variability: Min: 0 #; Max: 900 #
* Quality of Working Memory: Min : 0 # ; Max: 2 #
* Quality of Episodic Memory: Min: -400 #; Max: 400 #

Note: # denotes ""no specific unit""

Lower scores reflect poorer ability for Continuity of Attention, Quality of Working Memory, and Quality of Episodic Memory; thus, a negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline. Whereas, for Reaction Time Variability, higher scores reflect poorer ability, and a positive change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline., Change from Baseline to Week 20|The Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Verbal Fluency., Change from baseline in the Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS). The D-KEFS Verbal Fluency test is used for assessment of executive function and has three conditions: Letter Fluency, Category Fluency, and Category Switching. Higher scores indicate more correct responses. A positive value of change means an improvement and a negative value of change means deterioration. The minimum score is 0 and there is no concrete maximum score., Change from Baseline to Week 20|The Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) 1, 2, 3, and Total Score., Change from baseline in the Movement Disorder Society's Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The MDS-UPDRS contains 4 subscales: Part 1, Mentation, Behavior, and Mood; Part 2, Activities of Daily Living; Part 3, Motor; Part 4, Complications nonmotor experiences of daily living (13 items), motor experiences of daily living (13 items), motor examination (18 items), and motor complications (six items). The rating for each item is from 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The total score for each Part is obtained from the sum of the corresponding item scores. For this study, Parts 1-3 will be completed. Part 1 score ranges from 0 to 52. Part 2 score ranges from 0 to 52. Part 3 score ranges from 0 to 132. Total score possible is 0 to 236., Change from Baseline to Week 16|The Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SE-ADL) Scale., Change from baseline in the Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living (SE-ADL). The SE-ADL evaluates patients' perceptions of global functional capacity and dependence. Scoring is expressed in terms of percentage, in 10 steps from 100 to 0 (100%, normal status; 0%, bedridden with vegetative dysfunction), so that the lower the score, the worse the functional status. The range is 0% to 100%., Change from Baseline to Week 24|The Clinical Impression of Severity Index - PD (CISI-PD)., Change from baseline in The Clinical Impression of Severity Index PD (CISI-PD). The CISI-PD is a severity index formed by four items (motor signs, disability, motor complications, and cognitive status), rated 0 (not at all) to 6 (very severe or completely disabled); the possible scores range from 0 to 24. A total score is calculated by summing the item scores. Higher scores indicate worse severity. A negative value of change means an improvement and a positive value of change means deterioration., Change from Baseline to Week 24|The Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39)., Change from baseline in the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire of 39 questions relating to 8 key areas of health and daily activities, including both motor and non-motor symptoms. It is scored on a scale of 0 -100 with lower scores indicating better health and high scores indicating more severe symptoms., Change from Baseline to Week 20|The Geriatric Depression Scale-15 (GDS-15)., Change from baseline in the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). The GDS-15 is a 15-item yes/no questionnaire of depression in older adults. Each depressive answer is 1 point. The final score is the tally of the number of depressive answers with the following scores indicating depression: 0-4 No depression; 5-10 Suggestive of a mild depression; 11 + Suggestive of severe depression. The possible scores range from 0 - 15., Change from Baseline to Week 20|The Digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT)., Change from baseline in the digital clock drawing test (dCDT). The pen-like dCDT device will be used to gather the x-y coordinates that describe the movement of the stylus as it changes its position during the assessment. It also assesses when the stylus or writing device is not exerting pressure on the writing surface. The dCDT score is a number from 0 and 100 that represents a person's overall cognitive function as assessed by DCT clock. The total possible score is 100. A negative value of change means a deterioration and a positive value of change means an improvement., Change from Baseline to Week 20|Power of Attention, Cognitive Reaction Time, and Speed of Memory on the Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Cognition Battery (CDR-CCB) as Assessed by Change From Baseline in CDR-CCB., The CDR-CCB is an automated cognitive function assessment system.

NCT04821830,Vigor and the LDR in Parkinson Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04821830,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a common disorder in which reduced speed of movement results from inadequate brain production of the chemical dopamine. The most effective treatment for PD is the drug levo-dopa, which partially replaces brain dopamine. Despite decades of successful use, how levo-dopa improves speed of movement in PD is not understood. This observational study recruits participants who have been prescribed levo-dopa by their treating physicians. Before their first dose, immediately after their first dose and later, when their dose has been stabilized, they will engage with the research team to participate in a few simple experiments to measure speed, grip strength, tremor, and stability (on and off of treatment). The purpose of these experiments is to understand how levo-dopa treatment in Parkinson disease enhances movement speed. An important but not understood component of levo-dopa action, the Long Duration Response (LDR), lasts for days to weeks. A basic function of dopamine signaling in the brain is modulation of motivation - the coupling between effort and action values. These experiments will determine if the LDR is associated with relative normalization of motivation function in the brain. The motivation behavior of recently diagnosed PD participants will be examined before and after treatment with levo-dopa to determine if the magnitude of the LDR is correlated with improvements in motivation behavior.",YES,Parkinson Disease,"DRUG: carbidopa/levodopa, as prescribed by treating physician","Tapping Speed Task - Experiment 1, Measurement of bradykinesia.

NCT01602549,A Study to Assess the Effect of Repeat Doses of GSK962040 on the Pharmacokinetics of L-DOPA in Subjects With Parkinson's Disease Exhibiting Delayed Gastric Emptying,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01602549,,COMPLETED,"Gastric emptying is the end-result of a complex and carefully regulated series of events which follow the ingestion of a meal, each of which is dependent on the other and subject to neurohormonal control. Motilin is an endogenous peptide, produced mainly in the duodenum, whose physiological action is mediated by motilin receptors located on enteric neurons, peripheral terminals of the vagus, and on the smooth muscle of the gut. Motilin and non-peptide agonists at motilin receptors increases the gastric emptying rate and therefore provide a potential approach to the treatment of a range of clinical conditions in which delayed gastric emptying is thought to be part of the physiopathology and may be contributory to symptoms. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurones. It affects 1.5% of the global population over 65 years of age. Cardinal symptoms comprise bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremors and postural instability. Gastrointestinal dysfunction, including gastroparesis, is a frequent feature of PD affecting approximately 90% of patients, and is caused by autonomic dysfunction as well as an adverse effect of antiparkinsonian drug therapy. The therapeutic mainstay for PD treatment is the neutral amino acid L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), a dopamine prodrug, as it provides the most rapid and effective symptomatic control of motor impairment in PD. The primary determinant of L-DOPA bioavailability is gastric emptying (GE); delays in GE slow delivery of L-DOPA to its proximal small intestinal absorption sites, increasing the extent of presystemic metabolism, and leading to slowed and diminished absorption.",YES,Gastroparesis,DRUG: GSK962040 (25 mg tablet)|DRUG: Placebo,"Dose-normalized Levodopa (L-DOPA) Area Under the Plasma Concentration-time Curve From Zero to 4 Hours AUC(0-4) at Baseline, Dose-normalized L-DOPA AUC(0-4) was derived from L-DOPA plasma concentration-time data.

This study will be conducted in China. Subjects will have total 14 visits over the 26 week duration of the study.

Following screening, eligible subjects will receive study medication during the fourteen day placebo run-in period which they will be instructed to take in addition to their background L-dopa. If subjects are still eligible at the end of the placebo run-in period they will be randomized (1:1) to receive once daily doses of ropinirole PR or identical appearing placebo tablets. Dosing will start at 2 mg ropinirole PR, or placebo equivalent. During the 24 week treatment phase, the subjects dose will be adjusted according to the recommended schedule to achieve symptomatic control. All subjects must be titrated to a minimum dose of 6 mg/day. If sufficient symptomatic control is not achieved or maintained at a dose of 6mg/day of ropinirole PR, the daily dose should be increased by 2mg at weekly or longer intervals up to a dose of 8mg/day.If sufficient symptomatic control is still not achieved or maintained at a dose of 8mg/day of ropinirole PR, the daily dose should be increased by 4mg at two weekly or longer intervals. Further dose titration should not be conducted within the final 8 weeks of the treatment phase. The maximum recommended daily dose is 24mg.

The planned reduction in L-dopa dose will begin once subjects are titrated to Dose Level 4 or Dose Level 5 of study medication. For each increase in study medication, there will be a corresponding decrease in L-dopa. If loss of symptom control occurs with the reduction in the background L-dopa dose, the dose of study medication should be increased to the next higher dose level with no adjustment in the dose of L-dopa. If loss of symptom control persists, subjects should be titrated up an additional dose level. Subjects who do not experience an improvement in symptoms following upward titration by 2 dose levels of study medication, should be ""rescued"" with L-dopa.

NCT00376506,A Comparison of an Implanted Neuroprosthesis With Sensory Training for Improving Airway Protection in Chronic Dysphagia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00376506,,COMPLETED,"This study will compare an implant with the technique of sensory training to determine which method may improve the ability to swallow and reduce the risk of choking. Many people with a brain injury or neurological disorders experience difficulty in swallowing. Past studies have shown that an electrical pulse applied to muscles or an increase in sensory stimulation to the throat can help.

Patients ages 18 to 90 who have had a brain injury or neurological disorder and who have had trouble swallowing for 6 months or longer may be eligible for this study. Patients will undergo a physical examination, pregnancy test, and exam by a throat and speech physician. Fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing involves a flexible tube passed through the nose to the back of the throat to allow observation of the voice box. Videofluoroscopy, an X-ray of the head and neck, will be done while patients swallow. Patients experiencing trouble with the upper esophagus may undergo additional procedures, including manometry to measure pressure changes in the back of the throat, and reevaluation through the fiber-optic tube. Patients in this study will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses a strong magnetic field to obtain images of the body. Patients will lie on a table that slides into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. The scan will take 20 to 25 minutes.

Patients will be assigned randomly to one of two groups: the intramuscular group, to have a stimulation device implanted in the neck, and the vibrotactile group, to receive a vibrotactile stimulator. All patients will have 10 training sessions with their devices, plus follow-up. Those patients in the first group will undergo surgery, under general anesthesia, for the implant. Three weeks following the implant procedure, patients will come to NIH to have the stimulator turned on and programmed and to learn how to use the device. Those patients in the second group will have about 2 to 3 weeks of training in using a vibrotactile device, and then they will take it home to use. All patients will return to NIH at 3 months to ensure proper use of the devices, and they will visit for follow-up at 6 months and 12 months for tests and questionnaires.

NCT04649164,Learning to PERSEVERE: Peer Mentor Support and Caregiver Education in Lewy Body Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04649164,,COMPLETED,"The investigators propose to adapt, improve, and implement a peer mentor support and caregiver education (PERSEVERE) program to improve LBD-specific caregiving mastery. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common dementia, comprising Parkinson's Disease (PD) dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. LBD causes deterioration in multiple cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric domains, leading to heavy reliance on family caregivers. Patients with LBD are at a far greater risk of hospitalizations for falls, neuro-psychiatric symptoms, and infections, which are often preventable or treatable at home if recognized. Studies cite a crucial need for education and support of LBD caregivers, who face high rates of caregiver strain and adverse outcomes. Evidence from other chronic conditions supports peer mentoring as a potentially effective intervention to provide education and social support. PERSEVERE builds on our team's ongoing work of creating and testing a peer mentoring program for homebound PD patients' caregivers that has shown promising feasibility and acceptability. In the proposed project, the investigators will convene focus groups of former mentors and mentees, along with current caregivers, to provide formative information to shape the revised PERSEVERE curriculum that will include in-person mentor training and a comprehensive mentoring handbook. The curriculum will focus on key areas of LBD caregiving mastery, including: fall prevention, infections, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, and depression), and advance directives. The investigators will enroll and train a new cohort of 36 LBD caregiver peer mentors who will be matched with 30 current LBD caregivers. Each pair will be instructed to speak on a weekly basis, using the 16-week structured curriculum as a framework. The study team will support the mentors with monthly conference calls and day-to-day availability for concerns. The investigators will assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention via online study diaries tracking the frequency, duration, and content of calls. During mentor training, the investigators will assess the change in mentors' caregiver mastery and LBD knowledge pre- and post-training.

The treatment effect was measured by the hazard ratio (HR).

Relapse was defined as (1) ≥30% increase in SAPS-H+D total score from DB baseline (BL) and CGI-I score ≥6 relative to DB BL, (2) treatment with antipsychotic for dementia-related delusions/hallucinations, (3) treatment/study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, and/or (4) hospitalization for worsening dementia-related psychosis.

SAPS-H+D is a 20-item scale; the total score is the sum of the 20 item scores (range 0-100); higher scores denote more severe symptoms. CGI-I is a clinician-rated 7-point scale to rate improvement in hallucinations/delusions relative to BL (range 1-7); higher scores denote less improvement or worsening.

NCT02474329,Real-PD Trial: Development of Clinical Prognostic Models for Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02474329,,COMPLETED,"Background: Long-term management of Parkinson's disease (PD) does not reach its full potential due to lack of knowledge about disease progression. The Real-PD study aim to evaluate the feasibility and compliance of usage of wearable sensors in PD patients in real life. Moreover, an explorative analysis concerning activity level, medication intake and mood will be done.

Methods: Overall, 1000 PD patients and 250 physiotherapist will be enrolled in this observational study. Dutch PD patients will be recruited across the country and an assessment will be performed using a short version of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) protocol. Moreover, participants will wear a set of medical devices (Pebble Smartwatch, fall detector) and they will use a smartphone with The Fox Insight App (Android app), 24/7, during 13 weeks. Primary measures of interest are: 1) physical activity, falls and tremor, measured by the axial accelerometers embedded in the Pebble watch and fall detector; and 2) medication intake and mood reports measured by patients' self-report in the Android app. To measure motor impact, an assessment will be performed by physiotherapists who are all certified to perform the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).

Discussion: Management of PD patients is complex and appears to be a challenging task for health care professionals. The main reason is the lack of knowledge in the disease pattern. This issue could be solved by a long term follow-up of patients' during their everyday life, and wearable medical devices can act as a way to collect data about every day life activities. Therefore, the Real-PD study will be a first contribution in increasing the lack of knowledge in disease progression, developing a new medical decision system and improving PD patients' care.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,OTHER: Clinical assessment|DEVICE: Fox Insight self-monitoring android app and falls detector,"Parkinson's Disease Symptoms, The MDS-UPDRS is a revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). It was developed to evaluate various aspects of Parkinson's disease including non-motor and motor experiences of daily living, as well as motor complications. The MDS-UPDRS characterizes the extent and burden of disease across various populations. Here, we used data from one-point assessment (baseline). The total score used here was calculated by a sum of all scores from the 4 sub-scales (i.e. part I, up to part IV) composing the MDS-UPDRS. Total score ranges from 0 to 272. A higher score indicates higher disease severity and burden, being thus a worse outcome., Baseline|Depression Scores as a Measure of Depression Rates, The scores obtained with the Geriatric Depression Scale were analysed in order to create a percentage of probably depressed participants. The total score goes from 0 to 15. A score higher than 6 indicates higher probability of suffer from a depression., Baseline|Cognitive Impairment., Total sum score obtained with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We analyzed the full score to investigate percentage of participants with a possible cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive sum scores ranges from 0 to 30, in which a score lower or equal to 26 is considered as possible cognitive decline., Baseline|Independency Level, The total sum score obtained with the Schwab and England activities of daily living scale were analyzed to describe the functional level of the sample. The total sum scores varies from 0 to 100, in which lower scores are associated with more dependency of others to perform daily life activities., Baseline","Number of Falls Per Patient Registered by the Falls Detector., The fall event is recognized by the falls detector. Every time that the patient falls, the algorithm embedded at the falls detector recognize as a fall and record the fall event. At the end of the follow-up time, a sum of the falls event for each patient will be done., Patients will be automatically assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|Number of Mood Reports for Each Patient Measured With a Four Point Scale, The number of mood reports will be collected through the smartphone application. A four point scale (very good, good, poor and fair) will be available, and by pressing the button which correspond to how the patient feels at that moment the report can be performed. At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all the reports will be done in order to measure the number of mood reports over the follow-up time., Patients will be assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date). It is expected that the assessment (self-report) will be performed as many times as the patient wants to report how they feel or at least once a day.|Number of Medication Intake Annotations Made by Each Participant Via the Self-report App., The number of medication intake annotations made by the patients will be collected through the smartphone application. Every time that the patient take medication they must press the button reporting that they took the medication. At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all the reports will be done in order to measure the number of medication intake over the follow-up time., Baseline|Time That Each Patient Was Active During the Day, The time that the patient was active during the day is calculated automatically through the app at the smartphone. The calculation is performed by using an algorithm, which analyze the patterns of walk. This algorithm is able to predict when the patient was active in a zone above his/her usual threshold (e.g. when the patient was performing one activity that makes him/her more active than during a quiet time). At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all active hours will be done in order to measure the amount of time that the patient was active over the follow-up time., Patients will be automatically assessed continuously during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The analyses was limited to walking activities.|Level of Activity for Each Patient During the Day, The level of activity for each patient is calculated automatically through the app at the smartphone. The calculation is performed by using the data collect with the accelerometers embedded in the smartwatch. An algorithm installed in the phone, which analyze the data collected with the smartwatch, can calculate the level of activity for each patient throughout the day., Patients will be automatically assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|Scores in Autonomic Dysfunctions Measure With the Autonomic Dysfunctions Scale, The scores for autonomic dysfunctions will be obtained with the Assessment of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (SCOPA-AUT). The total sum scores ranges from 0 to 100, in which high scores are correlated with more burden of autonomic dysfunctions in Parkinson's patients., Baseline|Sleepiness Rates in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale as a Measure of Sleep Quantity., The Epworth sleepiness scale was used to rate the level of sleepiness during the day. The scale's scores are related to the usual duration of sleep at night and increase with relative sleep deprivation. Here, we used data from one-point assessment (baseline). Then, we can suggest that if the sample has high scores they will have a low sleep quantity. Total sum score ranges from 0 (no sleepiness at all) to 24 (excessive sleepiness)., Baseline",,Radboud University Medical Center,Michael J.

NCT04117178,Monitoring Anti-Dementia Drugs by Serum Levels,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04117178,MONANTI,COMPLETED,"The main objective of the MONANTI study is twofold:

Firstly, to determine the serum concentration (SC) the anti-dementia drugs donepezil and memantine in a broadly defined clinical population of patients suffering from dementia treated with the two drugs in question. Secondly, to determine whether adjustment of treatment of anti-dementia medication based on measurements of the SC will benefit patients in terms of cognitive performance, activities of daily living (ADL), frequency and severity of side effects.

The reason for conduction of this study is that the relationship between serum-level of anti-dementia drugs, clinical efficacy, compliance and side effects has only been scarcely investigated.

Both a previously published study and a preliminary (pilot)study conducted imply that roughly 50 % of patients on donepezil have SC outside the recommended therapeutic reference range (TRR).

Thus, MONANTI will investigate if this is indeed the case in a broadly comprised population of patients with dementia treated with donepezil or memantine. In addition, MONANTI will link SC to co-morbidity, level of compliance, medication interactions. It is hypothesized that the efficacy of anti-dementia drugs can be significantly improved by adjustment of treatment according to SC. Also, it is hypothesized that the burden of side effects can be reduced in patients in whom too high SC are detected, if dose reduction or change of treatment drug is done.

MONANTI is a randomized study, in which the assessor is blinded to avoid related biases to the extent possible.

To meet the enrollment criteria eligible participants must:

A) be newly diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy-bodies or Parkinson's disease with dementia and B) be scheduled for treatment with either donepezil or memantine. C) not meet a list of (exclusion) criteria, which have been set up in order to avoid blur and biases of the results.

D) be able to give written informed consent to participation in presence of a close relative.

After enrollment the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. In the first of these, the control group, the participants receive standard treatment and follow-up at the outpatient clinic. In addition, all participants in the control group who complete the trial will have a blood sample collected at the final visit to measure the SC of the anti-dementia drug along with a genetic test for a few key genes thought to be relevant for the study (two liver enzymes (cyp2D6, cyp3A4/5, APOE-genotype, butyrylcholine-esterase K-variant).

In the other group, the intervention group, the participators will be closely monitored for side effects after prescription of anti-dementia drugs. All participants in the intervention group will be offered a measurement of the SC in case they experience drug side effects within 2 months of treatment initiation. All participants in the intervention group will have a measurement of the SC done at the 6 months visit. The measured SC will be compared to the TRR of the drug in question. This information, along with details from the clinical assessment at the 6 month visit will be used to guide the decision of whether or not to adjust treatment. All decisions on treatment adjustment during the trial are done by the PI according to details in the protocol.

All participants in the intervention group are evaluated again at a 12 month visit, identical to that of the control groups.

To assess the possible effects of SC guided treatment adjustment six clinical tests/rating scales will be used (MMSE, ACE, NPI-Q, DAD, CGI, GDS). The tests/rating scales will be administered both at the enrollement visit and one year later at the final 12 month follow-up visit.

To measure the effect of donepezil on brain cholinergic function approx. 30 participants will be recruited for electroencephalography (EEG). These participants will have an EEG done at enrollment and after 12 months.

In addition to the above mentioned quantitative study a qualitative study with relatives of enrolled participants is planned.

All the needed approvals have been obtained according to Danish law (approval by the Danish Data Protection Agency, Scientific Ethics Committee for Region Sjaelland, The Danish Medical Agencies).",YES,Dementia|Dementia With Lewy Bodies|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia Alzheimers|Alzheimer Disease,DRUG: Donepezil|DRUG: Memantine|DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Measurement of serum level of anti-dementia drug,"Change of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Test Result, Widely used clinical test for brief assesment of cognitive function.

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.
