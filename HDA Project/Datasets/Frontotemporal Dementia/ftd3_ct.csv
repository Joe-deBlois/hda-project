NCT03422250,Non-invasive Stimulation of Brain Networks and Cognition in Alzheimer's Disease and Frontotemporal Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03422250,NetCogBs,COMPLETED,"This pilot study aims to test clinical and connectivity changes following non-invasive stimulation of disease-specific networks in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Brain network stimulation will be carried out with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Target networks will be the default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN). Twenty AD and 20 bvFTD patients will be recruited and assessed with a comprehensive clinical, behavioral and cognitive battery, and 3 Tesla MRI scan (including resting-state functional MRI, arterial spin labeling, diffusion tensor imaging, structural MRI) at three time-points: baseline, after tDCS, and after 6 months. Patients will be randomized to 2 arms: anodal stimulation of the disease-specific network (DMN in AD, SN in bvFTD) or cathodal stimulation of the anti-correlated network (SN in AD, DMN in bvFTD). The intervention will consist of 10 tDCS sessions over two weeks. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples will be collected at baseline for biomarker's assessment; blood samples will be collected at each time-point to assess changes in peripheral inflammatory markers. Blood and CSF collection will be optional. A sample of 20 elderly controls will be included for baseline comparisons.",YES,"Alzheimer's Disease|Frontotemporal Dementia, Behavioral Variant",DEVICE: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),"Change in Clinical Disease Severity (CDR), CDR - Clinical Dementia Rating score

The clinical dementia rating (CDR) is a clinical global rating scale administered to both the participant and the caregiver, assessing 6 domains of participant function: memory, orientation, judgement and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Each domain is based on a 5-point scale ranging from no impairment=0, questionable impairment=0.5, mild impairment=1, moderate impairment=2 to severe impairment=3. The global CDR score is computed via a memory-weighted averaging algorithm of the six domain scores and ranges from 0 to 5. The CDR-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) is the sum of the individual domain scores and ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate more clinical impairment. Negative changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement on the scale., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)|Change in Behavioral Symptom Severity (NPI), The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) is a behavioral scale administered to the caregiver assessing 12 dimensions: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, aberrant motor activity, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating. Each dimension has multiple screening questions relating to symptoms. If the answer to the screening questions is ""Yes"", the dimensional-score is the product of frequency (1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) and severity (1=Mild to 3=Severe) of symptoms. Dimensional-scores are summed (from 0 to 144). Higher scores indicate greater behavioral disturbances. Negative changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement on the scale., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)|Change in Behavioral Symptom Severity (FBI), The Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) is a 24-item inventory designed to assess behavior and personality changes via caregiver. Item-level scores range from 0=none, 1=mild/occasional, 2=moderate, 3=severe/most of the time. Item-scores are summed (from 0 to 72). Higher scores indicate greater behavioral/personality disturbances. Negative changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement on the scale., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)|Change in Functional Connectivity, Default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) mean functional connectivity is assessed on resting state functional MRI. Functional connectivity is standardized to Z scores and thresholded at Z\>2. Higher values denote greater functional connectivity. A positive change at post tDCS compared to baseline represents an increase in resting-state functional connectivity., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)|Change in Cerebral Blood Flow, Default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) mean cerebral blood flow is assessed on arterial spin labeling. Cerebral blood flow is computed by averaging values across the DMN and SN regions of interest. Cerebral blood flow is a measure of brain perfusion, higher values denoting higher perfusion. A positive change at post tDCS compared to baseline represents an increase in perfusion., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)","Change in Cognition: Memory, The composite memory score consists of the averaged Z-standardized scores of 5 memory tests: immediate and delayed auditory verbal learning test recall, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure recall, story recall, digit span backward and forward tests.

Scores are normalized to an independent dataset of healthy controls. Z-scores have no minimum/maximum values. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean and is considered normal. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Higher values denote better visuospatial performance. Positive changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement in visuospatial functions., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)|Change in Cognition: Emotion Recognition, The composite emotion recognition score consists of the averaged Z-standardized scores for 2 emotion recognition tests: reading the Mind in the Eyes and 60 Ekman faces tests. Each test score is normalized to an independent dataset of healthy controls. Z-scores have no minimum/maximum values. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean and is considered normal. Lower numbers indicate values lower than the mean and higher numbers indicate values higher than the mean. Higher values denote better emotion recognition performance. Positive changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement in emotion recognition., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)|Change in Structural Connectivity: FA, Fractional anisotropy (FA) is assessed on diffusion weighted imaging. FA values are averaged in default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions of interest. FA values denote the directionality of water diffusivity, ranging from 0 (isotropic diffusion) to 1 (anisotropic diffusion). Higher values denote higher directionality and connectivity. Positive changes at post tDCS compared to baseline represent an improvement in the measure., Baseline, post tDCS (week 3)|Change in Structural Connectivity: MD, AxD, RaD, Mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RaD) are assessed on diffusion weighted imaging. MD, AxD, RaD values are averaged in default mode network (DMN) and salience network (SN) regions of interest. MD, AxD, and RaD measure water diffusion and are expressed in mm\^2/s (starting from 0 with no maximum value; scaled at x10\^-3). Higher values denote higher diffusion and lower connectivity.

Each question is scored on a likert scale of ""never"" (0) to ""all the time (2). Higher scores represents more frequent symptoms. The reported scores are the mean/standard deviation for the first 7 questions (Category: Behavior)., 6 months","Change From Baseline in Perceived Stress Scale, The Perceived Stress Scale is a 14-item instrument that provides a global rating of an individual's belief in the severity and frequency of stressful experiences during the last month. The Perceived Stress Scale includes 14 items designed to assess symptoms of stress and global measures of the degree of stress experienced in the past month. Each item is scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very often), with total sum scores ranging from 0 to 56; higher scores indicate higher perceived stress., 6 months|Change From Baseline in Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), CES-D is a valid and reliable scale for detecting caregiver depression in dementia. The scoring is on a likert scale 0: Rarely or none of the time (less than 1 day), 1: Some or a little of the time (1-2 days), 2: Occasionally or a moderate amount of time (3-4 days), and 3: Most or all of the time (5-7 days). Higher scores represent greater depressive symptoms. Total scores can range 0 to 60. A score equal or above a 16 means a person is at risk for clinical depression., 6 months|Change From Baseline in Ways of Coping Questionnaire, Short Form, This 42-item questionnaire measures the use of five different coping styles: avoidance, problem-focused, seeking social support, self-blame, and wishful thinking. The original scale has been used widely since developed by Lazarus in 1985. The short version (30 items) uses a 4-point Likert-scale response format (0 = not used to 3 = used a great deal). Scores range from 0-90 with higher scores indicating greater coping. It is reliable (alpha 0.95) and has construct validity. This instrument has been used numerous times in studies with older adult caregivers., 6 months|Change From Baseline in Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), The ZBI has been used in numerous informal dementia caregiver studies to capture burden associated with providing care to a loved one. Total scores are summed and a range is provided for little to no burden (0-21) to severe burden (61-88)., 6 months|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Commonly used scale to evaluate 12 common behaviors in dementia including Delusions, Hallucinations, Agitation/Aggression, Depression, Anxiety, Elation/Euphoria, Apathy/Indifference, Disinhibition, Irritability, Aberrant motor behavior, Sleep and Nighttime Behavior Disorders, Appetite and Eating Disorders. Ratings include the frequency of the occurrence of behaviors (1 = occasionally, 2 = often, 3 = frequently, 4 = very frequently), and the level of severity of behaviors (1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). The behavioral domain total score is the product of the frequency score multiplied by the severity score for that behavior. The NPI total score is the sum of all the individual behavioral domains. Scores range from 0-144.
