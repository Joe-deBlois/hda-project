NCT03305809,A Study of LY3154207 in Participants With Dementia Due to Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) Associated With Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) or Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03305809,PRESENCE,COMPLETED,A randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses of study drug LY3154207 treated for 12 weeks in participants with mild-to-moderate dementia associated with LBD (PDD or DLB).,YES,Lewy Body Dementia,DRUG: LY3154207|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in the Continuity of Attention (CoA) Composite Score of the Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Cognition Battery (CDR-CCB), The CDR-CCB tests is designed to evaluate the effects of novel compounds on the quality of cognitive functioning which includes tests of attention (simple and choice reaction time, digit vigilance), working memory (spatial and numeric) and episodic memory (word recognition, picture recognition). Continuity of attention measures speed and accuracy and is calculated from 3 attentional tasks on the CDR computerized battery tests. For continuity of attention, the score range is -999 to 35. A high score reflects someone able to keep his/her mind on a single task for a prolonged period. A negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline. Data presented are model-based bayesian posterior mean response rates with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 12","Change From Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinician Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) Score, The ADCS-CGIC is a validated categorical measure of change in a participant's clinical condition between baseline and follow-up visits; it is used to assess global clinical status. The ADCS CGIC score is based on direct examination of the participant and an interview of the caregiver. The rater should refer to the baseline ADCS-CGIC worksheets in making a rating. A skilled and experienced clinician who is blinded to treatment assignment rates the participant on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). 1= Very much better 2= Much better 3= A little better 4= Same 5= A little worse 6= Much worse 7= Very much worse. Least squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for treatment + visit + treatment\*visit + age\*acheifl + age + concomitant use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI)., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline on the CDR-CCB Power of Attention (PoA) Composite Score, The PoA is a composite score derived from the CDR-CCB that measures the intensity of concentration (ability to focus attention): the faster the responses, the more processes are being brought to bear upon the task. Power of attention is calculated from the sum of three cognitive function speed tests: simple reaction time, choice reaction time and the speed of detections in digit vigilance task. Score ranges from 450 milliseconds - 61500 milliseconds. A low score reflects a fast reaction time and a high intensity of concentration. A positive change from baseline reflects impairment compared to the baseline assessment Values are calculated by a computer and higher scores mean better outcome. LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total Score + treatment + visit + treatment\*Visit + visit\*baseline total Score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline in the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), The ADAS is a rater administered instrument that was designed to assess the severity of the dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive behaviors characteristic of persons with AD. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS that was used as the primary efficacy measure consists of 13 items assessing areas of cognitive function most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation. The ADAS--Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total Score + treatment + visit + treatment\*Visit + visit\*baseline total Score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Screening in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score, The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a screening tool for global cognitive function with a total score ranging from 0 to 30 units on a scale. The MoCA is divided into 7 subscores (maximum possible subscore): visuospatial/executive (5 points), naming (3 points), memory (5 points for delayed recall), attention (6 points), language (3 points), abstraction (2 points) and orientation to time and place (6 points). A score of 26-30 is normal. A score less than 26 is considered as mild cognitive impairment. Higher values represent a better outcome. LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total Score + treatment + visit + treatment\*Visit + visit\*baseline total Score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Screening (Baseline), Week 12|Change From Baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score and Individual Item Scores, The NPI is a condition-specific measure designed to assess neuropsychiatric disturbances in people with Alzheimer Disease (AD),as well as other related dementing disorders.It assesses 12 behavioral disturbances,namely delusions,hallucinations,depression/dysphoria,anxiety,agitation/aggression,elation/euphoria,disinhibition,irritability/lability,apathy, aberrant motor activity, night-time behavior disturbances,and appetite/eating abnormalities.The frequency scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very frequently).The Severity scored from 0 (none) to 3 (marked).The domain score is obtained by multiplying frequency and severity scores.The total NPI score is sum total of all of individual domain scores (0-144).Higher score indiciates more abnormal behaviors.LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total score + treatment + visit + treatment\*visit + visit\*baseline total score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score, The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions.

NCT01023672,"""Pilot Study of Armodafinil in Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies""",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01023672,,COMPLETED,"This research study is to examine the effects of the study medication Armodafinil in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

DLB is associated with memory and other thinking problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, delusions, apathy, and reduced quality of life.

One type of medication that could potentially improve daytime sleepiness, memory and thinking skills, hallucinations, delusions, apathy, and quality of life is known as a wake-promoting medication. Armodafinil is a wake-promoting medication that has been developed for treatment of patients with narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and other disorders which cause excessive daytime sleepiness.

The drug used in this study is considered investigational, which means it has either not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use or for the use described in this study. However the FDA has allowed the use of this drug/device in this research study.

In this study, patients with DLB will receive daily oral Armodafinil tablets, and their response to treatment will be assessed over 12 weeks. This study does not involve any placebo medication, so all patients will receive Armodafinil treatment.",YES,Dementia With Lewy Bodies,DRUG: Armodafinil,"Mean Initial Sleep Latency as Measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), The MWT measures the subject's ability to stay awake while sitting quietly in a chair. The test has 4 parts, each lasting 40 minutes if the subject is able to remain awake that long each time, and the parts are spaced apart in 2 hour intervals through the day.

The subject is placed in a dim room, with the only source of light slightly behind the subject's head and out of his/her field of vision, and back and neck supported. During this time the subject is monitored with the same measures that are used in a standard overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram. The sleep latency, or time it takes the subject to fall asleep, will be recorded.

In healthy people, the time it takes to fall asleep may be approximately 30 minutes on the test. More than 97% of people will take eight minutes or longer to fall asleep.

It is a semi-structured global rating derived from a comprehensive interview with the participant and caregiver or informant by an independent rater who has no access to the source data or other psychometric test scores conducted post-randomization as part of the protocol. The CIBIC-Plus was a 7-point scale and scores were: 1 (marked improvement), 2 (moderate improvement), 3 (minimal improvement), 4 (no change), 5 (minimal worsening), 6 (moderate worsening), and 7 (marked worsening). Higher values represent a worse outcome., Week 12","Clinician's Global Impression of Change - In Dementia With Lewy Bodies (CGIC-DLB) Scale at Week 12 of Treatment, Number of participants are reported categorized in grades based on the CGIC-DLB scale. The CGIC-DLB scale provided an overall clinician-determined summary measure of change from the participant's clinical status that takes into account all available information from the efficacy endpoints (which include cognitive function, non-cognitive symptoms, behavior, and the impact of the symptoms on the participant's ability to function) and safety data. The (CGIC-DLB) was a 7-point scale and scores were: 1 (marked improvement), 2 (moderate improvement), 3 (minimal improvement), 4 (no change), 5 (minimal worsening), 6 (moderate worsening), and 7 (marked worsening). Higher values represent a worse outcome., Week 12|Mean Change From Baseline in the Cognitive Fluctuation Inventory (CFI) Score at Week 12 of Treatment, The CFI scale assessed cognitive fluctuation. It evaluates fluctuation in various domains including attention, ability to perform daily functions, orientation, verbal communication and behavior. The score was based on frequency and severity with a score range of 0 to 12. The scale also assessed the degree of caregiver or informant distress engendered by the symptoms. Higher scores indicating greater impairment., Baseline and Week 12|Mean Change From Baseline in the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Total Score Week 12 of Treatment, The MMSE is a 30-point scale that measured orientation to time and place, registration, immediate and delayed recall, attention, language, and drawing. The total score ranges from 0 (most impaired) to 30 (no impairment). The lower score means severe cognitive deficit and higher score indicates better function., Baseline and Week 12|Mean Change From Baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12) Total Score at Week 12 of Treatment, The NPI-12 scale assessed the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly described in dementia participants: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating changes. The scale also assessed the degree of caregiver or informant distress engendered by each of the symptoms. The sum of the composite scores for the 12 domains yielded the NPI-12 total score. NPI-12 total score ranged from 0 (minimum severity) to 144 (maximum severity); higher score indicates greater neuropsychiatric disturbance., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline in NPI-4 Subscore at Week 12, The NPI scale assesses the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly described in dementia participants: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating changes. NPI-4 is the subscore covering the domains of delusions, hallucinations, apathy and depression. NPI-4 total subscore ranged from 0 to 48, with higher scores indicating a greater neuropsychiatric disturbance., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline in NPI-10 Subscore at Week 12, The NPI-10 assessed range of behaviors seen in dementia for both frequency and severity. It is a 10 item questionnaire with the following domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/liability and aberrant motor behavior. The total score was a sum of the 10 domains, where the score of each domain was calculated as frequency (scale: 1=occasionally to 4=very frequently)\*Severity (scale: 1=Mild to 3=Severe). Each domain has a maximum score of 12 and all domains were equally weighted for total score, the range for total score is 0 to 120. Higher scores indicating a greater neuropsychiatric disturbance., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline in NPI-D (Caregiver Distress) Total Score at Week 12, The NPI-D scale assesses the frequency and severity of 12 neuropsychiatric symptoms commonly described in dementia participants: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/lability, motor disturbance, nighttime behaviors, and appetite/eating changes. The scale assesses the degree of caregiver distress engendered by each of the symptoms. The caregiver distress (NPI-D) is rated by caregiver based on his or her own stress on a five point scale from 0 to 5, where: 0(no distress), 1(minimal), 2(mild), 3(moderate), 4(moderately severe), 5(very severe or extreme). NPI-D total score is calculated by summing the scores of the 12 sub-scale distress scores. The NPI-D total scores ranges from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicating greater distress., Baseline and Week 12|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Severe TEAEs, Serious TEAEs, Adverse Events (AEs) Resulting in Study Discontinuation, A TEAE was defined as an AE that emerged or worsened in severity relative to baseline during treatment or within 28 days after the last dose of study drug. Severe TEAE was defined as inability to work or to perform normal daily activity. A Serious TEAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening (that is, the participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue, might have caused death) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is medically important due to other reasons than the above mentioned criteria. An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered an investigational product., From first dose of study drug up to Week 16|Number of Participants With Orthostatic Hypotension, Orthostatic hypotension was defined as drop in standing systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to (\>=) 20 Millimeter of mercury (mmHg) compared to supine, or drop in standing diastolic blood pressure \>=10 mmHg compared to supine., Week 2, Week 4, Week 6, Week 9 and Week 12|Number of Participants With Orthostatic Tachycardia, Orthostatic tachycardia by numerical criteria was defined by the following numerical criteria: Standing heart rate (HR) increased by \>30 beats/min compared to supine and absolute standing HR was \>100 beats/min., From first dose of study drug up to Week 16|Number of Participants With Markedly Abnormal Laboratory Values, A laboratory value was determined to be a markedly abnormal value if the postbaseline common toxicity criteria grade increased from baseline and the post-baseline grade was greater than or equal to 2., From first dose of study drug up to Week 16|Number of Participants With Abnormal Electrocardiogram (ECG) Findings, From first dose of study drug up to Week 16|Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation or Suicidal Behavior as Measured Using Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), The C-SSRS (mapped to Columbia Classification Algorithm of Suicide Assessment (C-CASA) categories); is an interview-based instrument to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assess whether participant experience any of the following: completed suicide; suicide attempt (response of ""yes"" on ""actual attempt""); preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (""yes"" on ""preparatory acts or behavior"", ""aborted attempt"" or ""interrupted attempt""), suicidal ideation (""yes"" on ""wish to be dead"", ""non-specific active suicidal thoughts"", ""active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent, any self-injurious behavior with no suicidal intent (""yes"" on ""has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior"").

Each score on the individual tests was converted to a z-score, and then a total z-score for the composite was calculated, in which each test is weighted equally. As the analysis is based on z-scores, there is no minimum or maximum value. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. A positive change in z-score indicate an improvement in cognition, i.e., a better outcome; and a negative change in z-score indicates a worsening in cognition, i.e., a worse outcome., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, all time points at which NTB was assessed utilized in the analysis.

The CDR score ranges from 0 (no impairment), 0.5 (questionable impairment), 1 (mild impairment), 2 (moderate impairment), and 3 (severe impairment). The domain (box) scores are then added for a Sum of Boxes score. With six domains, the CDR-SB score then ranges from 0 to 18; with higher scores indicated worse outcomes., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which CDR-SB was assessed (week 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis.

The MMSE was assessed at Week 8 and Week 16 during the study., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which MMSE was assessed (week 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10) - Mean Change in Hallucinations Domain Score, The NPI-10 consists evaluates ten domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor activity. If caregiver reports symptoms within a domain then the caregiver rates the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, and severity on a 3-point scale. Total score for each domain is the frequency score multiplied by the severity score; i.e. the domain score (e.g. for hallucinations) for any one domain ranges from 0-12, with higher scores indicating worsening. A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of neflamapimod in four specific domains, specifically depression (dysphoria), anxiety, hallucinations, and agitation/aggression, in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo-recipients. Of these four, the only domain in which more than one-quarter of the patients reported symptoms is hallucinations, and the result of this analysis is reported., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, all time points at which NPI-10 was assessed (weeks 4, 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis.

The immediate recall score consists of the number of words that the subject correctly repeats during three consecutive trials immediately following provision of words. The range is then from 0 to 36 (12 words maximum in each of 3 trials), with higher scores (i.e., the more words recalled) reflecting better outcomes., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which ISLT was assessed (Weeks 4, 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), The Timed Up and Go test assesses function mobility, and was included in the study to evaluate the effects of neflamapimod on motor function. The TUG measures the time in seconds that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around 180 degrees, walk back to the chair, and sit down while turning 180 degrees. The TUG was evaluated at Baseline, and Weeks 8 and 16 of the study. There is no minimum or maximum value for this test, though in Parkinson's disease patients values above 11.5 seconds was associated with an increased risk of falls and each one second increase in the time required to complete the TUG is associated with a 5.4% increase in the risk of falls (Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2013;94: 1300-1305). That is, an increase in the time required to complete the TUG is a worse outcome., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which the TUG was assessed (week 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG)m - Dominant Peak Frequency Over Parietal Lobe, Change in quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) parameters with the subject awake in accordance with the 10-20 International System of Electrode placement was to be evaluated as a potential biomarker for DLB. However, due to COVID19 related restrictions, baseline and week 16 EEG recordings were obtained only in limited number of subjects. As slowing of the dominant frequency band by qEEG over posterior aspects of the brain has been recognized to be prominent in DLB, the change in the dominant frequency band over the parietal lobe in Hz from baseline to week 16 is reported. This is a continuous variable with no minimum or maximum. A decrease in the frequency (i.e., slowing) reflects worsening of disease, while a positive treatment effect would be an increase in the frequency.

NCT04649164,Learning to PERSEVERE: Peer Mentor Support and Caregiver Education in Lewy Body Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04649164,,COMPLETED,"The investigators propose to adapt, improve, and implement a peer mentor support and caregiver education (PERSEVERE) program to improve LBD-specific caregiving mastery. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common dementia, comprising Parkinson's Disease (PD) dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. LBD causes deterioration in multiple cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric domains, leading to heavy reliance on family caregivers. Patients with LBD are at a far greater risk of hospitalizations for falls, neuro-psychiatric symptoms, and infections, which are often preventable or treatable at home if recognized. Studies cite a crucial need for education and support of LBD caregivers, who face high rates of caregiver strain and adverse outcomes. Evidence from other chronic conditions supports peer mentoring as a potentially effective intervention to provide education and social support. PERSEVERE builds on our team's ongoing work of creating and testing a peer mentoring program for homebound PD patients' caregivers that has shown promising feasibility and acceptability. In the proposed project, the investigators will convene focus groups of former mentors and mentees, along with current caregivers, to provide formative information to shape the revised PERSEVERE curriculum that will include in-person mentor training and a comprehensive mentoring handbook. The curriculum will focus on key areas of LBD caregiving mastery, including: fall prevention, infections, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, and depression), and advance directives. The investigators will enroll and train a new cohort of 36 LBD caregiver peer mentors who will be matched with 30 current LBD caregivers. Each pair will be instructed to speak on a weekly basis, using the 16-week structured curriculum as a framework. The study team will support the mentors with monthly conference calls and day-to-day availability for concerns. The investigators will assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention via online study diaries tracking the frequency, duration, and content of calls. During mentor training, the investigators will assess the change in mentors' caregiver mastery and LBD knowledge pre- and post-training.

NCT04117178,Monitoring Anti-Dementia Drugs by Serum Levels,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04117178,MONANTI,COMPLETED,"The main objective of the MONANTI study is twofold:

Firstly, to determine the serum concentration (SC) the anti-dementia drugs donepezil and memantine in a broadly defined clinical population of patients suffering from dementia treated with the two drugs in question. Secondly, to determine whether adjustment of treatment of anti-dementia medication based on measurements of the SC will benefit patients in terms of cognitive performance, activities of daily living (ADL), frequency and severity of side effects.

The reason for conduction of this study is that the relationship between serum-level of anti-dementia drugs, clinical efficacy, compliance and side effects has only been scarcely investigated.

Both a previously published study and a preliminary (pilot)study conducted imply that roughly 50 % of patients on donepezil have SC outside the recommended therapeutic reference range (TRR).

Thus, MONANTI will investigate if this is indeed the case in a broadly comprised population of patients with dementia treated with donepezil or memantine. In addition, MONANTI will link SC to co-morbidity, level of compliance, medication interactions. It is hypothesized that the efficacy of anti-dementia drugs can be significantly improved by adjustment of treatment according to SC. Also, it is hypothesized that the burden of side effects can be reduced in patients in whom too high SC are detected, if dose reduction or change of treatment drug is done.

MONANTI is a randomized study, in which the assessor is blinded to avoid related biases to the extent possible.

To meet the enrollment criteria eligible participants must:

A) be newly diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy-bodies or Parkinson's disease with dementia and B) be scheduled for treatment with either donepezil or memantine. C) not meet a list of (exclusion) criteria, which have been set up in order to avoid blur and biases of the results.

D) be able to give written informed consent to participation in presence of a close relative.

After enrollment the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. In the first of these, the control group, the participants receive standard treatment and follow-up at the outpatient clinic. In addition, all participants in the control group who complete the trial will have a blood sample collected at the final visit to measure the SC of the anti-dementia drug along with a genetic test for a few key genes thought to be relevant for the study (two liver enzymes (cyp2D6, cyp3A4/5, APOE-genotype, butyrylcholine-esterase K-variant).

In the other group, the intervention group, the participators will be closely monitored for side effects after prescription of anti-dementia drugs. All participants in the intervention group will be offered a measurement of the SC in case they experience drug side effects within 2 months of treatment initiation. All participants in the intervention group will have a measurement of the SC done at the 6 months visit. The measured SC will be compared to the TRR of the drug in question. This information, along with details from the clinical assessment at the 6 month visit will be used to guide the decision of whether or not to adjust treatment. All decisions on treatment adjustment during the trial are done by the PI according to details in the protocol.

All participants in the intervention group are evaluated again at a 12 month visit, identical to that of the control groups.

To assess the possible effects of SC guided treatment adjustment six clinical tests/rating scales will be used (MMSE, ACE, NPI-Q, DAD, CGI, GDS). The tests/rating scales will be administered both at the enrollement visit and one year later at the final 12 month follow-up visit.

Caregiving of sexual/gender minority older adults with AD/RD is of concern due to social stigma, marginalization, and isolation, which may be barriers to sustaining caregiving. It is necessary and timely to translate evidence-based culturally adaptable interventions for this underserved and stigmatized population. Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD) has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and has shown to successfully train community-dwelling CR (care receiver)-CG dyads to increase the physical activity and functioning of individuals with AD/RD and their CGs and to teach CGs techniques for managing behavioral symptoms of CRs. RDAD consequently decreases stress of CGs, delays institutionalization of CRs, and increases health related quality of life (HRQOL) of CRs and CGs. Thus, this study will evaluate the effect of the standard RDAD among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) CRs with AD/RD and their CGs, and this study will test a personalized intervention tailored to better respond to distinct risks experienced by CGs and LGBT CRs with AD/RD, addressing unique sexual/gender minority CG risk factors (e.g., identity management, stigma-related adverse or traumatic life events, and lack of social support).",YES,Alzheimer Disease|Dementia|Mild Cognitive Impairment|Parkinson Disease Dementia|Lewy Body Dementia|Vascular Dementia,BEHAVIORAL: Innovations in Dementia Empowerment and Action (IDEA)|BEHAVIORAL: Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD),"Change in Physical Activity of Care Recipient, Measured by the days of aerobic activity for at least 30 minutes in the past week with higher numbers indicating more days of activity., Baseline, 6 weeks(pre-treatment), 13 weeks(post-treatment), 30 weeks, 13 months","Depression of Care Partner: Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD-10), Assessed using the summed score on the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD-10).

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.

The treatment effect was measured by the hazard ratio (HR).

Relapse was defined as (1) ≥30% increase in SAPS-H+D total score from DB baseline (BL) and CGI-I score ≥6 relative to DB BL, (2) treatment with antipsychotic for dementia-related delusions/hallucinations, (3) treatment/study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, and/or (4) hospitalization for worsening dementia-related psychosis.

SAPS-H+D is a 20-item scale; the total score is the sum of the 20 item scores (range 0-100); higher scores denote more severe symptoms. CGI-I is a clinician-rated 7-point scale to rate improvement in hallucinations/delusions relative to BL (range 1-7); higher scores denote less improvement or worsening.

The primary hypothesis is that in participants with mHSPC, the combination of pembrolizumab plus enzalutamide plus ADT is superior to placebo plus enzalutamide plus ADT with respect to 1) radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) and 2) overall survival (OS). As of Amendment 4, the study is being stopped for futility. All the prespecified interim analysis after interim analysis (IA1) and final analysis of the study described the statistical analysis plan (SAP) will not be performed. Safety analysis will be performed at the end of the study; there will be no further analyses for efficacy and electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) endpoints collected from participants beyond the IA1 cutoff date. All study participants will stop ongoing treatment with pembrolizumab/placebo. Exceptions may be requested for study participants who, in the assessment of their study physician, are benefitting from the combination of enzalutamide and pembrolizumab, after consulting with the Sponsor. All other study participants should be discontinued from study and be offered standard of care (SOC) treatment as deemed necessary by the Investigator. If enzalutamide as SOC is not accessible off study to the participant, central sourcing may continue. As of Amendment 04, disease progression will no longer be centrally verified, participants will only be assessed locally. As of Amendment 4, Second Course treatment is not an option for participants.

Parts 1 and 2 are open-label to find and confirm the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD) for Pembro+D+T. The primary hypothesis (Parts 1 and 2) is that Pembro+D+T is sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation.

Part 3 is a double-blind study of Pembro+D+T versus placebo+D+T. The primary study hypothesis (Part 3 only) is that the Pembro+D+T improves progression-free survival (PFS) compared with placebo+D+T.

Part 4 is nonrandomized and open-label and is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability and identify the MTD or MAD of Pembro+T in participants who have v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 \[BRAF\] mutation-negative (without V600 E or K) melanoma or solid tumors \[irrespective of BRAF status\]. The primary hypothesis (Part 4) is that Pembro+T is sufficiently well-tolerated to permit clinical investigation.

Part 5 will confirm the dose(s) identified in Part 4 in participants BRAF wild type \[without V600E or K\] melanoma or solid tumors \[irrespective of BRAF status\] and will further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy (Objective Response Rate \[ORR\]) of Pembro+T in participants who have BRAF wild type \[without V600E or K\] melanoma or solid tumors \[irrespective of BRAF status\]. The primary hypotheses (Part 5) are that Pembro+T is sufficiently well-tolerated at the MTD/MAD to permit further clinical investigation and is effective in attaining objective responses based upon Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by Investigator review in participants who have melanoma without BRAF V600 E or K mutations. With Amendment 5 (21-Mar-2019), the Part 5 expansion cohort will not be pursued following the completion of Part 5 dose confirmation.

Parts 1 and 2 of the study may also explore, if needed based on tolerability, the backup combinations of open-label Pembro+T (for BRAF mutation-negative participants) or Pembro+D (for BRAF mutation-positive participants).

Initial Treatment Period:

Participants were initially randomized to receive either low-dose (2 mg/kg) pembrolizumab, higher dose (10 mg/kg) pembrolizumab or Investigator-choice chemotherapy (ICC). The four standard chemotherapy choices were: carboplatin + paclitaxel, paclitaxel alone, dacarbazine, or temozolomide. The randomization to either pembrolizumab or ICC was conducted in an open-label fashion.

The starting pembrolizumab dose was initially blinded to Investigators and participants until Amendment 03. With Amendment 03, all ongoing pembrolizumab participants were to be treated with open label, fixed dose pembrolizumab 200 mg, instead of a weight-based dosing of pembrolizumab.

Switch-to-Pembrolizumab Treatment Period:

Participants who were initially randomized to receive ICC and experienced progressive disease (PD) may have been eligible to switch to receiving pembrolizumab provided they met protocol-specified requirements for switching. Qualified participants were re-randomized to receive either pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg in a double-blind fashion. Participants who qualified to switch to pembrolizumab must have completed a washout period of ≥28 days from last dose of chemotherapy before receiving pembrolizumab.

BPI-SF assesses pain intensity; for item 3, participant responses to ""Please rate your pain at its worst in the last 24 hours"" are scored from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). A higher score indicates greater pain. AQA captures the intensity of analgesic use in pain management, scored from 0 (no analgesic) to 7 (strong opioid use). A higher score indicates higher intensity of analgesic use.

For participants asymptomatic at baseline, PP was ≥2-point change from baseline in BPI-SF item 3 score OR initiation of opioid use. For participants symptomatic at baseline, PP was ≥2-point change from baseline in the BPI-SF Item 3 score, a score of ≥4 and no decrease in average opioid use OR any increase in opioid use (e.g., 1 point change in AQA score).

NCT03834519,Study of Pembrolizumab (MK-3475) Plus Olaparib Versus Abiraterone Acetate or Enzalutamide in Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer (mCRPC) (MK-7339-010/KEYLYNK-010),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03834519,KEYLYNK-010,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of the combination of the polyadenosine 5'-diphosphoribose poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor olaparib and pembrolizumab in the treatment of participants with mCRPC who have failed to respond to either abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide (but not both) and to chemotherapy.

The primary study hypotheses are that the combination of pembrolizumab plus olaparib is superior to abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide with respect to:

1. Overall Survival (OS) and
2. Radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) per Prostate Cancer Working Group (PCWG)-modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 as assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR)

As of Amendment 06, the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) is no longer applicable. Participants still on treatment may have the option to continue receiving study intervention or SOC if they are deriving clinical benefit, until criteria for discontinuation are met. Participants who are still on study treatment and deriving clinical benefit will no longer have tumor response assessments by BICR. However, local tumor imaging assessments should continue per standard of care (SOC) schedule. In addition, electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments will no longer be performed and biomarker samples will no longer be collected.",YES,Prostatic Neoplasms,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Olaparib|DRUG: Abiraterone acetate|DRUG: Prednisone|DRUG: Enzalutamide|DRUG: Prednisolone,"Overall Survival (OS), Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. The nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves., Up to ~31 months|Radiographic Progression-Free Survival (rPFS), rPFS is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1 based on BICR or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also have demonstrated an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions or ≥2 new bone lesions was also considered PD. PCWG-modified RECIST is similar to RECIST 1.1 with the exception that a confirmation assessment of PD (\>4 weeks after the initial PD) is required for participants who remain on treatment following a documented PD per RECIST 1.1 and PCWG rules include new bone lesions. The rPFS per PCWG-modified RECIST as assessed by BICR for all participants is presented. The nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves., Up to ~26 months","Time to Initiation of the First Subsequent Anticancer Therapy (TFST), TFST is the time from randomization to initiation of the first subsequent anticancer therapy defined as the first anti-cancer treatment not part of the study arm for a given participant, or death, whichever occurs first. The nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves., Up to ~26 months|Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with Complete Response (CR: disappearance of all target lesions per RECIST 1.1 and no evidence of disease (NED) bone scan) or Partial Response (PR: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions per RECIST 1.1 and Non-PD, non-evaluable (NE), or NED bone scan or CR with non-PD or NE bone scan.) The percentage of participants who experienced CR or PR as assessed by BICR is presented., Up to ~31 months|Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until progressive disease (PD) or death. Per PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1, PD is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of ≥ 2 new bone lesions is also considered PD. DOR as assessed by BICR is presented., Up to ~26 months|Time to Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) Progression, Time to PSA progression is defined as the time from randomization to PSA progression. PSA progression date is defined as the date of:

1\) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL above the nadir, confirmed by a second value ≥3 weeks later if there is PSA decline from baseline, OR 2) ≥25% increase and ≥2 ng/mL increase from baseline beyond 12 weeks if there is no PSA decline from baseline. The nonparametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curves., Up to ~31 months|Time to First Symptomatic Skeletal-Related Event (SSRE), SSRE is defined as the time from randomization to the first symptomatic skeletal-related event, defined as whichever occurs first:

* Occurrence of spinal cord compression; or
* Tumor-related orthopedic surgical intervention, Up to ~31 months|Time to Radiographic Soft Tissue Progression, Time to radiographic soft tissue progression is defined as the time from randomization to radiographic soft tissue progression per soft tissue rule of PCWG-modified RECIST 1.1. Progression is defined as at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression. Time to radiographic soft tissue progression as assessed by BICR is presented., Up to ~31 months|Time to Pain Progression (TTPP), TTPP is defined as the time from randomization to pain progression as determined by Item 3 of the Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) and by the Analgesic Quantification Algorithm (AQA) score.

Pain progression is defined as:

1. For participants who are asymptomatic at baseline, a ≥2-point change from baseline in the average (4-7 days) BPI-SF item 3 score at 2 consecutive visits OR initiation of opioid use for pain
2. For participants who are symptomatic at baseline (average BPI-SF Item 3 score \>0 and/or currently taking opioids), a ≥2-point change from baseline in the average BPI-SF Item 3 score and an average worst pain score ≥4 and no decrease in average opioid use (≥1-point decrease in AQA score from a starting value of 2 or higher) OR any increase in opioid use at 2 consecutive follow-up visits.

Participants who had more than 2 consecutive visits that were not evaluable for pain progression were censored at the last evaluable assessment., Up to ~31 months|Number of Participants Who Experience an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment. The number of participants who experienced an adverse event are presented., Up to ~55 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinue Study Treatment Due to an Adverse Event (AE), An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, temporally associated with the use of study treatment, whether or not considered related to the study treatment.

NCT03517449,Lenvatinib in Combination With Pembrolizumab Versus Treatment of Physician's Choice in Participants With Advanced Endometrial Cancer (MK-3475-775/E7080-G000-309 Per Merck Standard Convention [KEYNOTE-775]),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03517449,,COMPLETED,"This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, KEYTRUDA®) in combination with lenvatinib (E7080) versus treatment of physician's choice (doxorubicin or paclitaxel) for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either pembrolizumab and lenvatinib or treatment of physician's choice. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with lenvatinib prolongs progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) when compared to treatment of physician's choice.",YES,Endometrial Neoplasms,DRUG: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Lenvatinib|DRUG: Paclitaxel|DRUG: Doxorubicin,"Progression-free Survival (PFS), PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression, as determined by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 or death due to any cause (whichever occurred first). Disease progression was defined as at least 20 percent (%) increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter \[mm\]) in the sum of diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS was estimated and analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method., From the date of randomization to the date of the first documentation of disease progression or death, whichever occurred first or up to data cutoff date 26 October 2020 (up to approximately 2 years 5 months)|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants who were lost to follow-up and those who were alive at the date of data cut-off were censored at the date the participant was last known alive, or date of data cut-off, whichever occurred first., From the date of randomization until the date of death from any cause or up to data cutoff date 26 October 2020 (up to approximately 2 years 5 months)","Objective Response Rate (ORR), ORR was defined as the percentage of participants who had best overall response of either complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) as determined by BICR per RECIST 1.1. CR was defined as the disappearance of all target and non-target lesions (non-lymph nodes). All pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have a reduction in their short axis to less than (\<) 10mm. PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters., From date of randomization up to first documentation of PD or date of death, whichever occurred first up to data cutoff date 26 October 2020 (up to approximately 2 years 5 months)|Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Assessed by European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQC30) Score, EORTC QLQ-C30 was a questionnaire which included 30 questions that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Scores are transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using a standard EORTC algorithm. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problem.

The primary study hypotheses are that:

* Neoadjuvant and adjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab is superior to neoadjuvant and adjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy, followed by adjuvant placebo in terms of Event-free Survival (EFS) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1), and
* Neoadjuvant pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to neoadjuvant placebo plus chemotherapy in terms of rate of Pathological Complete Response (pathCR) at the time of surgery.

The primary hypotheses for this study are that:

1. Pembrolizumab + lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab + placebo with respect to Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR), and
2. Pembrolizumab + lenvatinib is superior to pembrolizumab + placebo with respect to Overall Survival (OS).

Based on recommendation of the external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC), Amendment 3 (effective: September \[Sep\]-24-2021) was implemented to unblind the study and discontinue lenvatinib and placebo treatment. The eDMC was then disbanded.

With Amendment 4 (effective: December-5-2022) second course pembrolizumab will no longer be offered. Any participant receiving second course pembrolizumab treatment prior to initiation of Amendment 4 will be able to complete treatment as planned. Study participation will end after the final administration of pembrolizumab. Participants who either complete 35 administrations of pembrolizumab or discontinue pembrolizumab will discontinue from the study following the safety follow-up visit.

The primary study hypotheses are that pembrolizumab+EP prolongs Progression-free Survival (PFS) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR) and Overall Survival (OS) compared with placebo+EP in adult participants with ES-SCLC. In this study, RECIST 1.1 has been modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ.

With protocol Amendment 07 (03-Oct-2018), the outcome measure of ""Change from Baseline at Weeks 12 and 24 in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Global Health Status/Quality of Life Scale"" was replaced with a single time point analysis at Week 18.",YES,Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC),BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Normal saline solution|DRUG: Carboplatin|DRUG: Cisplatin|DRUG: Etoposide,"Progression-free Survival (PFS) Per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) as Assessed by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR), PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first documented progressive disease (PD) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. PD, as determined by RECIST 1.1, was defined as ≥20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of ≥5 mm. The appearance of one or more new lesions was also considered PD. For this study, RECIST 1.1 was modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. The PFS was calculated using the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method for censored data and presented for the first course of study treatment per protocol., Up to approximately 30.5 months|Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause.

The total number of participants randomized depended upon demonstration of sufficient objective responses at an interim analysis.

Eligible participants who were allocated to the first course of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W) and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to receive a second course of pembrolizumab as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.

Protocol Amendment 12 (effective date: 09 Dec 2015) enabled eligible participants who were allocated to docetaxel and experienced disease progression, to be permitted to switch over to receive pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W as long as Inclusion/Exclusion criteria were met.

With Protocol Amendment 15 (effective date: 03 Jan 2018), all second course and switch over participants will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg Q3W. Response or progression during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards efficacy outcome measures, and adverse events during the second and switch over pembrolizumab courses will not count towards safety outcome measures.

The primary hypothesis is that pembrolizumab in combination with CRT is superior to placebo in combination with CRT with respect to event-free survival (EFS).,YES,Head and Neck Neoplasms,BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab|DRUG: Placebo|DRUG: Cisplatin|RADIATION: Accelerated Fractionation (AFX) Radiotherapy|RADIATION: Standard Fractionation (SFX) Radiotherapy,"Event-free Survival (EFS), EFS was defined as the time from date of randomization to the date of first record of any of the following events: death due to any cause; progression per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) by blinded independent central review (BICR) or biopsy as indicated for locoregional progression or recurrence or distant metastasis. As well as the first record of the following types of surgery: salvage surgery for persistent or residual disease at the primary tumor site requiring surgical removal when invasive cancer is present on final pathology; neck dissection or surgery (performed for clinical or radiological disease progression per RECIST 1.1) ≤ 20 weeks from end of CRT when invasive cancer is present; or neck dissection or surgery \>20 weeks from end of CRT when invasive cancer is present. The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the EFS curve in each treatment group., Up to approximately 62 months","Overall Survival (OS), OS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of analysis were censored at the date the participant was last known to be alive. The non-parametric Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the survival curve in each treatment group., Up to approximately 62 months|Number of Participants Who Experienced an Adverse Event (AE), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE is any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy. The number of participants who experienced an AE is presented., Up to approximately 88 months|Number of Participants Who Discontinued Study Drug Due to an AE, An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered study drug and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the study drug. An AE is any sign, symptom, disease, or worsening of preexisting condition temporally associated with study therapy and irrespective of causality to study therapy. The number of participants who discontinued study drug due to an AE is presented., Up to approximately 15 months|Change From Baseline in European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) Global Health Status (Item 29) Score, The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30-item questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients. For Global Health Status (GHS) (Item 29), participants are asked ""How would you rate your overall health during the past week?"" Individual items are scored on a 7-point (1=very poor to 7=excellent). Raw scores for each scale are standardized into a range of 0 to 100 by linear transformation, with a higher score indicating a better level of function and better overall GHS. A change from baseline of 10 points on the 100-point EORTC QLQ-C30 scale is considered as clinically relevant.

It consists of 7 multi-item scales (pain in the mouth, problems with swallowing, senses, speech, social eating, social contact, and sexuality). Participant responses to the swallowing scale (Items 35-38) were scored on a 4-point scale (1=Not at all to 4=Very much). Raw scores were standardized by linear transformation so that scores ranged from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating more problems. Change from baseline in swallowing was measured.
