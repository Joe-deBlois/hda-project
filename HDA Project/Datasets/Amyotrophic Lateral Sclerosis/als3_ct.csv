NCT02781454,Mexiletine in Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02781454,Mexiletine-2,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this research study is to find out whether the drug mexiletine will be effective in lowering motor neuron electrical activity in the brains and nerves in the arms of people with ALS. The investigators will also determine if there are any signs that the drug may slow down the progression of ALS and reduce muscle cramps and muscle twitching. This will be determined through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and threshold tracking nerve conduction studies (TTNCS). In this trial, the participants will be taking either 300mg/day of mexiletine, 600mg/day of mexiletine, or placebo (non-active study drug).",YES,Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,DRUG: Mexiletine|DRUG: Placebo,"Change in Resting Motor Threshold, The resting motor threshold (RMT) assessed from single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measurements made before treatment, after 4 weeks of treatment, and then again after a 4 week washout, was used as the primary pharmacodynamic marker of cortical hyperexcitability. RMT is the stimulus intensity required to produce and maintain a 0.2 mV peak-to-peak motor evoked potential of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle by TMS. A smaller RMT is thought to suggest greater neuronal excitability., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 and from Week 4 to Week 8 reported","Effect on Short-interval Intracortical Inhibition, Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is a measure of neuronal excitability measured by dual pulse TMS with a conditioned (80% of RMT) and test pulses (120% of RMT) to generate a stable MEP amplitude of 0.2 mV, averaged over interstimulus intervals of 1-7 ms. It is thought to reflect refractory cortical axons and subsequent resynchronization of cortico-cortical and corticomotoneuronal volleys or activation of non-GABAergic cortical inhibitory circuits (initial phase) and synaptic neurotransmission through GABAA receptors (second phase). The value for SICI thought to be maximally sensitive for detecting in changes in ALS subjects compared to controls is is derived by measuring the motor evoked potential amplitude (MEP) at an interstimulus interval of 3 ms (ISI 3 ms) and normalizing to the MEP amplitude at 120% of the resting motor threshold (MEP 120% RMT). A reduction in SICI reflecting greater excitability would generate a larger ratio of MEP ISI 3 ms/MEP 120% RMT., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Change in Motor Evoked Potential Amplitude, The motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude is taken from single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and reflects the density of corticomotoneuronal projections onto motor neurons and is affected by cortical hyperexcitability early in ALS where it is thought to be larger than age-matched controls and axonal degeneration later in the disease when it decreases in amplitude. The MEP is most reliable in assessing cortical motor neuronal preservation and excitability when normalized to the peak compound nerve action potential (CMAP) amplitude which reflects the integrity of peripheral motor nerve axons. It is also normalized here to 120% of the RMT to derive a ratio of MEP at 120% RMT/peak CMAP., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Cortical Silent Period, The cortical silent period (CSP) is recorded with single pulse TMS as a duration from the onset of the MEP response to resumption of voluntary electromyography activity with the patient performing a voluntary contraction, set to 30% of maximal voluntary contraction. A shorter CSP compared to controls would reflect greater excitability., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Strength Duration Time Constant, The strength duration time constant (SDTC) is used in threshold tracking nerve axonal excitability studies and is interpreted as a measure of axonal excitability that is dependent upon the biophysical properties of the axonal membrane at the node of Ranvier, especially persistent sodium current. It is derived from the relationship between stimulus duration and intensity. A higher SDTC would reflect greater excitability of motor nerve axons., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Depolarizing Threshold Electrotonus (90-100 ms), Depolarizing threshold electrotonus (90-100 ms) (TEd 90-100 ms) is used in threshold tracking nerve axonal excitability studies in which long-lasting subthreshold depolarizing currents are generated, measured at 90-100 ms following the stimulus. This measure is associated with a decrease in the membrane excitability threshold due to opening of potassium channels on the axonal membrane. Intrinsic changes in axonal excitability properties, such as thought to occur in ALS, could possibly alter this measure, presumably by decreasing TEd 90-100 ms more substantially than normal., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Hyperpolarizing Threshold Electrotonus (90-100 ms), Hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus (90-100 ms) (TEh 90-100 ms) is used in threshold tracking nerve axonal excitability studies in which long-lasting subthreshold hyperpolarizing currents are generated, measured at 90-100 ms following the stimulus. This measure is associated with an increase in the membrane excitability threshold due to closure of potassium channels causing increased resistance of the internodal axonal membrane. Intrinsic changes in axonal excitability properties, such as thought to occur in ALS, could possibly alter this measure., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Superexcitability, Superexcitability is a component of recovery cycle analysis assessing motor axonal excitability, employing threshold tracking nerve conduction study. It is a depolarizing afterpotential measured following a single supramaximal stimulus followed by a second smaller stimulus of variable intensity and reflects passive depolarization of the internodal axon., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Subexcitability, Subexcitability is a component of recovery cycle analysis assessing motor axonal excitability, employing threshold tracking nerve conduction study. It is a late hyperpolarizing after potential measured following a single supramaximal stimulus followed by a second smaller stimulus of variable intensity and is related to the very slow turn-off of slow potassium channels., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Frequency of Muscle Cramps, Will be assessed using a daily muscle cramps diary tabulated weekly beginning at Baseline., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; comparisons of treatments at Weeks 3-4 reported|Effect on Frequency of Fasciculations (Muscle Twitching), Will be assessed using a daily fasciculations diary tabulated as a percentage of days from weeks 3-4., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; comparisons of treatments at Weeks 3-4 reported","Change in the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised, The Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R) is an instrument for evaluating the functional status of patients with ALS that includes functions related to speech, swallowing, salivation, fine motor control, gross motor function, and respiration. The score is the sum of 12 items (range 0 to 48) with higher scores reflecting better function., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Change in Slow Vital Capacity, Measure of decline in respiratory muscle strength, Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported",University of Washington,Massachusetts General Hospital,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,20,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",MX-ALS-002,2016-10,2018-09-30,2018-09-30,2016-05-24,2019-12-05,2019-12-05,"Barrow Neurological Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|University of California, Irvine, Orange, California, 92868, United States|Augusta University, Augusta, Georgia, 30912, United States|Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02215, United States|University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, United States|Columbia Universtiy Medical Center, New York, New York, 10032, United States|Pennsylvania State Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania, 17033, United States|University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 15213, United States|Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, 29425, United States|University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, 98195, United States","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/54/NCT02781454/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/54/NCT02781454/SAP_001.pdf"
