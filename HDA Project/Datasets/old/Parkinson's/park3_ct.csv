The frequency is assessed for the 15 sleep problems based on a 5-point Likert-type scale (ranging from 0 \[never\] to 4 \[very often\] with the exception of Question 1 score ranging from 0 \[very often\] to 4 \[never\]). Scores are calculated for each of the 3 domains as well as a total score. The PDSS-2 domain scores range from 0 to 20 and the total score is a sum of the 3 domains and ranges from 0 to 60. Higher scores indicate higher frequency and more severe impact of PD on sleep.

The EQ-5D-5L descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions of health (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) to describe the participant's current health state. Each dimension comprises 5 levels with corresponding numeric scores, where 1 indicates no problems, and 5 indicates extreme problems. The health status is converted to an index value using the country-specific weighted scoring algorithm for the United States (US). The summary index value for the US ranges from a worst score of -0.109 to a best score of 1.

NCT04380142,Study Comparing Continuous Subcutaneous Infusion Of ABBV-951 With Oral Carbidopa/Levodopa Tablets For Treatment Of Motor Fluctuations In Adult Participants With Advanced Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04380142,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurological condition, which affects the brain. PD gets worse over time, but how quickly it progresses varies a lot from person to person. Some symptoms of PD are tremors, stiffness, and slowness of movement. This study measures the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ABBV-951 versus oral Levodopa (LD)/Carbidopa (CD) \[LD/CD\] in advanced PD participants to achieve reduction in motor fluctuations.

ABBV-951 is an investigational (unapproved) drug containing Levodopa Phosphate/Carbidopa Phosphate (LDP/CDP) given subcutaneously (under the skin) for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. Adult participants with advanced PD will be enrolled. Approximately 130 participants will be enrolled in the study in approximately 80 sites across the world.

In one arm, participants will receive ABBV-951 solution as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral placebo capsules for LD/CD. In the second arm, participants will receive placebo solution for ABBV-951 as a continuous infusion under the skin plus oral capsules containing LD/CD tablets. The treatment duration is 12 weeks.

There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital or clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests, checking for side effects, and completing questionnaires.",YES,Parkinson's Disease (PD),DRUG: ABBV-951|DRUG: Placebo for Levodopa/Carbidopa (LD/CD)|DRUG: Levodopa/Carbidopa (LD/CD)|DRUG: Placebo for ABBV-951,"Change From Baseline to Week 12 of the Double-Blind Treatment Period in Average Daily Normalized ""On"" Time Without Troublesome Dyskinesia, ""On"" time is defined as periods of good motor symptom control, and was assessed by the Parkinson's Disease (PD) diary.

The ketogenic diet uses fats as a person's major energy source rather than carbohydrates. There is increasing interest in using this diet to treat neurodegenerative disorders like Parkinson's disease. Researchers want to learn more about the ketogenic diet before recommending this diet in clinical practice.

Objective:

To study the effects of a ketogenic diet for someone with PD.

Eligibility:

People over age 50 with mild to moderate PD.

Design:

Participants will be screened with surveys and a 10-foot walking test. They will have a medical history, physical exam, and blood test.

Participants will be contacted twice in a 1-week period to discuss what they ate over the last 24 hours. They will log data about their daily exercise and activities using an online fitness tracking app.

Participants will stay at NIH Clinical Center for 1 week. They will be put into 1 of 2 groups. One group will follow a ketogenic diet and take MCT oil. The other group will follow a low-fat diet. Their body measurements will be taken. They will meet with a physical therapist and nutritionist.

Participants will have daily respiratory and glucose monitoring. They will have cognitive tests and complete surveys. They will have walking, motor function, and reaction time/finger tapping tests. They will have heart and nerve function tests. They will have electrocardiograms and electroencephalograms. Blood will be taken twice daily.

Participants will follow the ketogenic diet at home for 2 weeks. They will log their activities using the fitness tracking app. Then they will have a follow-up visit at NIH.

Participation in the trial will last for 4 weeks.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Liquigen MCT oil|OTHER: Standard American Diet,"Feasibiilty of Ketogenic Diet - Retention (Co-primary Endpoint), Analysis of feasibility was determined by 3 co-primary endpoints: retention, adherence, and acceptability, measured at the end of week 3 (outpatient segment). After each co-primary endpoint was calculated, three benchmark criteria were used to determine feasibility. All criteria must be met for feasibility to be positive.

Benchmark criteria for Retention was defined as a completion rate at study end (week 3) of \>80%, i.e., \>80% of participants must remain in the study at the 3 week time point., Week 3|Feasibility of Ketogenic Diet - Adherence (Co-primary Endpoint), Analysis of feasibility was determined by 3 co-primary endpoints: retention, adherence, and acceptability, measured at the end of week 3 (outpatient segment). After each co-primary endpoint was calculated, three benchmark criteria were used to determine feasibility. All criteria must be met for feasibility to be positive.

Benchmark criteria for Adherence was defined as a mean net carbohydrate intake of \</=10% during the 2 week outpatient period. Mean net carbohydrate intake was determined using the following calculation: (total carbohydrates minus total dietary fiber) x 4 divided by total calories., Week 3|Feasibility of Ketogenic Diet - Acceptability (Co-primary Endpoint), Analysis of feasibility was determined by 3 co-primary endpoints: retention, adherence, and acceptability, measured at the end of week 3 (outpatient segment). After each co-primary endpoint was calculated, three benchmark criteria were used to determine feasibility. All criteria must be met for feasibility to be positive.

Acceptability was defined via an exit survey (at end of study week 3) using a 4-point Likert scale to indicate how likely the participant would continue the diet on at least an intermittent basis in the future with 1 representing ""Very likely"" and 4 representing ""Very unlikely"". The benchmark criteria for Acceptability was defined as at least 2 out of 4 on the Likert scale., Week 3","Timed Up and Go (TUG), The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility. The TUG measures the time required to perform a sequence of activities, i.e.,sit-to-stand transfer, straight walking, turning, and walk-to-sit transfer. The TUG is administered at baseline, and each day during the inpatient visit. The results represent a comparison of the group mean score at the end of admission (day 7) for the two cohorts, i.e., patients receiving a Ketogenic Diet and patients receiving a Standard American Diet.

The benefit of 60Hz stimulation persisted during the 6-week study period, but with worsening tremor in one patient. However, it remains unknown whether the benefit of 60Hz would persist on prolonged stimulation period, and whether there is carry-over effect across different conditions. Hence, the investigators would like to test the hypothesis that the 60Hz stimulation, compared to 130Hz might have persistent benefit over an extended period in reducing the swallowing dysfunction, FOG, and other axial symptoms in these PD patients even after correcting the potential carry-over effect.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,DEVICE: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) at 60 Hz|DEVICE: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) at 130 Hz|DEVICE: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Off (Sham),"Frequency of Aspiration Events on Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study at Visit 1, A speech pathologist used the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS) to rate swallows captured by a radiologist during VFSS recording.

Total score for Part I (nM-EDL) and Part II (M-EDL) each ranges from 0-52; for Part III (motor examination) ranges from 0-72; and for Part IV (motor complications) ranges from 0-24; with higher scores in each range for all 4 parts reflecting greater severity., Baseline, Month 3|Change From Baseline in Non-motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) Total Score at Month 3, Non-motor symptoms were evaluated using the NMSS which was divided into 30 questions in 9 different domains including such symptoms as dribbling saliva, constipation, depression, sleep disorders, apathy, hallucinations and dementia. Symptoms were quantified based on their severity (using a scale of 0 \[none\] to 3 \[severe\]) and frequency (using a scale of 0 \[rarely\] to 4 \[very frequent\]). Total score derived from adding up the product of the frequency score times severity score for each of the 30 questions. Total score ranged from 0 to 360, with a lower score indicating fewer symptoms., Baseline, Month 3|Change From Baseline in Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire - 39 (PDQ-39) Score at Month 3, The PDQ-39 is a self-administered questionnaire for participants with Parkinson's disease that has 39 questions grouped in 8 dimensions: mobility (items 1-10), activities of daily living (items 11-16), emotional well-being (items 17-22), stigma (items 23-26), social support (items 27-29), cognitions (items 30-33), communication (items 34-36), and bodily discomfort (items 37-39). Each item was scored on a 5-point Likert scale (0 to 4) to indicate the frequency of each event; 0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often, and 4 = always or cannot do at all. Each dimension's total score ranged from 0-100, with lower scores indicating better health, and higher scores indicating more severe symptoms., Baseline, Month 3|Change From Baseline in EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Score at Month 3, EQ-5D is a questionnaire designed to provide measures of health-related quality of life states, consisting of 5 domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). Each dimension has a 3 point response scale designed to indicate the level of the problem: 1 = no problems, 2 = some problems, 3 = extreme problems. A higher score indicated an increase in the level of problem. The EQ-5D also contains a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), which records the respondent's self-rated health status on a vertical graduated visual analog scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Higher score indicated improvement., Baseline, Month 3|Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score, MoCA is a 30-point questionnaire for cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. Scores on the MoCA range from 0-30 with 26-30 indicating normal global cognition; 18-25 mild cognitive impairment; 10-17 moderate cognitive impairment; and \<10 severe cognitive impairment., Month 3|Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) Score, The BDI is a self-reporting 21-item scoring tool that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression, including physical symptoms. Each of the 21 items on BDI tool represent a depressive symptom. The symptoms are each scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 (symptom is absent) to 3 (symptom is severe). Scores for each symptom are added up to obtain the total scores for all 21 items, which are interpreted as follows 1-10 (normal); 11-16 (mild mood disturbance); 17-20 (borderline clinical depression); 21-30 (moderate depression); 31-40 (severe depression); and \>40 (extreme depression). Participants with symptom score of 0 were not included in the summary., Month 3|Change From Baseline in Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) Total Score at Month 3, The MADRS is a clinician-rated tool for measuring changes in depressive symptom severity. Ten core symptoms and cognitive features (feelings of sadness, lassitude, pessimism, inner tension, suicidality, reduced sleep or appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of interest) were rated on a severity scale of 0 (no symptoms)) to 6 (symptoms of maximum severity). The total score was the sum of the scores on the 10 items, ranging from 0 to 60 with a higher score indicating increasing depressive symptoms., Baseline, Month 3|Change From Baseline in Time to Complete Time Up and Go (TUG) Test in ON State at Month 3, Timed motor tests are simple, objective, quantitative measures for the assessment of Parkinson's disease. They include, in on-medication and off-medication state, timed recorded physical movements. Time Up and Go Test (TUG) is one of timed motor tests which is used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. This is a walking assessment.

The novel pharmacokinetic profile of ADS-5102 is expected to achieve i) maximal concentrations in the early morning through mid-day, when LID can be troublesome, and ii) lower concentrations in the evening, potentially reducing the negative impact of amantadine on sleep. This pharmacokinetic profile could enable higher doses to be tolerated with a once-nightly ER formulation than can be tolerated with an immediate-release formulation. The once-nightly dosing regimen may also provide enhanced convenience and compliance.

The SOT measures sway during 6 scenarios. In scenarios 1-3 the base is stable and eyes are open, then closed, and then the visual surround moves. SOT 1-3 is an average measurement of equilibrium - the average center of gravity sway for each condition. It generates a score of 0 (fall) up to 100 for each scenario and an overall composite score.

The test provides information about visual search speed, scanning, speed of processing, and executive functioning. Part A measures processing speed and part B measures executive functioning. The TMT is time to complete each part of the test in seconds. Higher scores indicate greater impairment. Subtracting part A from part B is theorized to reduce the influence of the working memory and visuospatial demands and, therefore, provides a relatively pure indicator of executive function. Change score is measurement (Part B - Part A) at 16 weeks minus measurement (Part B - Part A) at baseline, negative scores indicate a improvement in executive functioning., Baseline, 16 weeks|Change in Quality of Life as Recorded Using Quality of Life Scales (PDQ39), The PDQ39 is a 39 item patient completed survey targeting well-being and functioning in PD.

The PDQ39 dimension scores are on a scale of 0 (""Never"") to 4 (""Always/Cannot Do""). Scale scores are summed and range from 0 to 100 with 100 being the maximum level of problems. For a single index figure to characterize the impact of Parkinson's disease upon PD patients (PDSI), all 39 items of the PDQ39 can be summed. The PDQ39 and the use of a PDSI have shown adequate reliability and convergent validity.

NCT03192046,Bracing for Walking in Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03192046,,COMPLETED,"Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disease that results in characteristic gait dysfunction. Gait problems include decreased velocity, decreased stride length, difficulty with initiation of gait, postural stability problems and alteration in joint kinematics.1 In this typically older patient population, these gait deviations affect their participation in household and community activities. The standard of care is currently focused on therapeutic exercise and cueing of various types (visual, auditory, verbal). Current interventions have not been demonstrated to markedly improve gait kinematics, so there is a need to identify interventions that could improve gait performance in this population. Lower extremity bracing is a common and well-established intervention for gait dysfunction with other populations, including stroke and brain injury. The braces allow for improved stability, sensory feedback, and consistent tactile cues to allow patients to have the best gait mechanics with each step. It is reasonable to hypothesize that appropriate bracing may have the potential to improve gait function and kinematics in PD since these patient often have gastroc-soleus weakness. Data from our early pilot studies indicates that bracing individuals with PD can positively impact their mobility. This includes improvements in velocity, step length, and dynamic balance.

The test is a reliable and valid evaluation of functional exercise capacity and is used as a sub-maximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance. The test will be used to determine participant's gait efficiency at baseline and at 6 months. While the total distance covered during six minutes (6MWTD) is often used as the standard measurement of gait capacity (i.e., the maximum distance one can achieve), the endurance (i.e., ability to maintain speed over a prolonged time) can be inferred by the gait speed trajectory (GST) during the 6MW test (6MWGST)., Baseline and 6 months","Change in Step Length, Participants will be asked to walk on a 12-16 foot long vinyl pad placed on the floor.

NCT00297778,Pramipexole Versus Placebo in Parkinson's Disease (PD) Patients With Depressive Symptoms,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00297778,,COMPLETED,"Parkinsons Disease (PD) is caused by a decrease of dopamine in a particular part of the brain. Dopamine is a messenger substance (neurotransmitter) that is used by the cells of the brain (nerve cells) to control and harmonize muscle movements. Consequently, the main manifestations of the disease affect movement and include tremor, muscular rigidity, slowness in performing movements and loss of balance.

However, the disease affects also other, non motor functions and may cause other disorders, such as depression. Depression may be a reaction to the disability caused by the disease, but many studies show that depression is more common in PD than in other chronic debilitating illnesses. Moreover, there is also a biological explanation for the phenomenon: dopamine is also used in brain circuits involved in the experience of pleasure, and loss of pleasure in daily physical or social activity is one of the key manifestations of depression.

The objective of the study is to assess whether pramipexole, at doses approved for the treatment of PD symptoms, is more effective than placebo in resolving depressive symptoms in PD patients.

Continuity of attention measures speed and accuracy and is calculated from 3 attentional tasks on the CDR computerized battery tests. For continuity of attention, the score range is -999 to 35. A high score reflects someone able to keep his/her mind on a single task for a prolonged period. A negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline. Data presented are model-based bayesian posterior mean response rates with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 12","Change From Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinician Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) Score, The ADCS-CGIC is a validated categorical measure of change in a participant's clinical condition between baseline and follow-up visits; it is used to assess global clinical status. The ADCS CGIC score is based on direct examination of the participant and an interview of the caregiver. The rater should refer to the baseline ADCS-CGIC worksheets in making a rating. A skilled and experienced clinician who is blinded to treatment assignment rates the participant on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). 1= Very much better 2= Much better 3= A little better 4= Same 5= A little worse 6= Much worse 7= Very much worse.

Power of attention is calculated from the sum of three cognitive function speed tests: simple reaction time, choice reaction time and the speed of detections in digit vigilance task. Score ranges from 450 milliseconds - 61500 milliseconds. A low score reflects a fast reaction time and a high intensity of concentration. A positive change from baseline reflects impairment compared to the baseline assessment Values are calculated by a computer and higher scores mean better outcome.

The cognitive subscale of the ADAS that was used as the primary efficacy measure consists of 13 items assessing areas of cognitive function most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation. The ADAS--Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total Score + treatment + visit + treatment\*Visit + visit\*baseline total Score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Screening in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score, The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a screening tool for global cognitive function with a total score ranging from 0 to 30 units on a scale. The MoCA is divided into 7 subscores (maximum possible subscore): visuospatial/executive (5 points), naming (3 points), memory (5 points for delayed recall), attention (6 points), language (3 points), abstraction (2 points) and orientation to time and place (6 points). A score of 26-30 is normal. A score less than 26 is considered as mild cognitive impairment. Higher values represent a better outcome.

NCT00753519,Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Treat Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00753519,,COMPLETED,"This study will look at the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on symptoms of Parkinson's disease. TMS is a method of brain stimulation that may be able to change the activity of the nerve cells of the brain. This study will examine the effects of a specific pattern of stimulation called intermittent theta-burst TMS (iTBS), which uses repeated magnetic pulses delivered in short bursts.

People with mild to moderately severe Parkinson's disease who are between 40 and 80 years of age and whose main problems are slow movement and stiffness may be eligible for this study.

Participants undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Random assignment to real or placebo (sham) iTBS treatment.
* iTBS sessions (real or sham) 4 times a week for 2 consecutive weeks. For this test, the subject sits in a comfortable chair. A wire coil is held on the subject's scalp, and a brief electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg.
* Test of gait (walk), hand and arm movements before and after each session. The gait test requires walking 10 meters (about 30 yards) in the same corridor with the same shoes.
* Extended testing. The first and last gait tests (done before starting iTBS and after the eighth session) require coming off any Parkinson's medication for at least 12 hours before the test. On these test days, subjects also undergo a clinical examination, short neuropsychological test battery, a computer-based reaction time test and depression and quality-of-life rating scales. These procedures are repeated in a follow-up visit 1 month after the last session.",YES,Parkinson Disease,DEVICE: Real iTBS|DEVICE: Sham iTBS,"Gait Speed, Gait speed was assessed by measuring the time it takes to walk 10 meters. Subject's gait speed was measured while on medication and off medication for each group, i.e., real iTBS and sham iTBS. Two trials were averaged for each condition. Patients were instructed to walk fast without taking the risk of falling, wearing the same shoes and consistently using assistive devices if needed. Gait speed was measured at baseline, 1 day post intervention, and 1 month post intervention., baseline, 1 day post iTBS","Bradykinesia, Bradykinesia refers to the slowness in executing a movement. Bradykinesia was assessed by measuring the time in seconds it takes to do the following sequence, 10 times: 1) hand closing and opening while squeezing a ball 2) elbow flexion 3) hand closing and opening, and 4) elbow extension. Subjects were allowed to practice these hand and arm movements until performance appeared not to get faster, and then were abstained from further practice to minimize learning effects. The time it takes subjects to execute the entire sequence 10 times with either the left or right arm/hand was measured. Means are reported for each group., baseline, 1 day post iTBS|Total UPDRS Score, The Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an overall assessment scale that quantifies the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The total UPDRS score consists of mentation, behavior, mood, activities of daily living and motor components, and ranges from 0 (not affected) to 176 (most severely affected). The total UPDRS score is obtained from patient examination, interview and patient questionnaires., baseline, 1 day post iTBS|Motor UPDRS, The Motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) includes only the motor assessment of the UPDRS (Part III) and examines speech, facial expression, tremor at rest, action tremor, rigidity, finger taps, hand movements, hand pronation and supination, leg agility, arising from chair, posture, gait, postural stability and body bradykinesia.

NCT00977184,50 Hz Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) for the Treatment of Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00977184,,COMPLETED,"Background:

* In transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a device creates a short-lasting magnetic field which induces an electric current in the brain leading to a change in the activity of brain cells. There are different effects on the brain with different rates of stimulation. In a previous study in people with Parkinson's disease, repetitive TMS (rTMS) given at a particular rate temporarily improved their ability to walk. A faster rate of rTMS may be more effective in treating symptoms than the rate originally used.
* This study will compare active rTMS to inactive (sham or Placebo) rTMS. Half of the people in this study will have active rTMS; the other half will have no brain stimulation with rTMS.

Objectives:

\- To see if a faster rate of transcranial magnetic stimulation is a more effective treatment for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease than the slower rates that have been studied.

Eligibility:

* Individuals between 40 and 80 years of age who have been diagnosed with mild or moderate Parkinson's disease.
* Participants must currently be taking Sinemet or dopamine agonists drugs (e.g., bromocriptine, cabergoline, pergolide, pramipexole, ropinirole, apomorophine, and rotigotine), and are willing to continue their same treatments for the duration of the study.

Design:

* This study requires 11 outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center over 6 weeks. Participants can also be admitted and stay as an inpatient in the NIH Clinical Center for the entire study period (for the 10 visits during the first weeks and the follow-up visit a month later).
* Initial visit will consist of a physical examination; a test of participants' time to walk 10 meters; and questions about memory, mood, and quality of life. Participants should not take Parkinson's disease medications for 12 hours before this visit; once the examinations and tests are complete, participants will be able to take the medications. Researchers will repeat the tests 1 hour after participants take the medication.
* TMS sessions: 8 TMS sessions (4 sessions per week) over 2 weeks. Each stimulation session will last half an hour. Half of the participants will receive active TMS; the other half will receive sham TMS.
* The first 10 participants will have additional tests to study the safety of rapid TMS in patients with Parkinson's disease.
* A day after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication as in the first assessment and respond to questions about mood, memory, and quality of life.
* One month after completing the last TMS session, participants will repeat the same tests as the first visit before and after taking their medication.",YES,Parkinson Disease,PROCEDURE: 50 HZ Repetitive TMS|PROCEDURE: Sham rTMS,"Gait Speed, Gait speed was assessed by measuring the time it takes to walk 10 meters. Subject's gait speed was measured while on medication and off medication for each group, i.e., real rTMS and sham rTMS. Two trials were averaged for each condition. Patients were instructed to walk fast without taking the risk of falling, wearing the same shoes and consistently using assistive devices if needed. Gait speed was measured at baseline and 1 day post intervention., Baseline, 1 day post rTMS","Bradykinesia, Bradykinesia refers to the slowness in executing a movement. Bradykinesia was assessed by measuring the time in seconds it takes to do the following sequence, 10 times: 1) hand closing and opening while squeezing a ball 2) elbow flexion 3) hand closing and opening, and 4) elbow extension. Subjects were allowed to practice these hand and arm movements until performance appeared not to get faster, and then abstained from further practice to minimize learning effects. The time it takes subjects to execute the entire sequence 10 times with either the left or right arm/hand was measured. Means are reported for each group., Baseline, 1 day post rTMS|Total UPDRS Score, The Total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is an overall assessment scale that quantifies the signs and symptoms of Parkinson's disease. The total UPDRS score consists of mentation, behavior, mood, activities of daily living and motor components, and ranges from 0 (not affected) to 176 (most severely affected). The total UPDRS score is obtained from patient examination, interview and patient questionnaires., Baseline, 1 day post rTMS|Motor UPDRS, The Motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) includes only the motor assessment of the UPDRS (Part III) and examines speech, facial expression, tremor at rest, action tremor, rigidity, finger taps, hand movements, hand pronation and supination, leg agility, arising from chair, posture, gait, postural stability and body bradykinesia. The scores range from 0 (no motor impairment) to 108 (severe motor impairment). The Motor UPDRS was administered at baseline and at 1 day post rTMS or sham. Subjects were assessed on medication and off medication., Baseline, 1 day post rTMS|Activities of Daily Living UPDRS, The Activities of Daily Living Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (ADL UPDRS) is a self evaluation of the activities of daily living. The following variables are rated: speech, salivation, swallowing, handwriting, cutting food and handling utensils, dressing, hygiene, turning in bed, falling, freezing when walking, walking, tremor and sensory complaints. Each variable is rated on a scale of 0 (normal) to 4 (severe impairment).

Many people with a brain injury or neurological disorders experience difficulty in swallowing. Past studies have shown that an electrical pulse applied to muscles or an increase in sensory stimulation to the throat can help.

Patients ages 18 to 90 who have had a brain injury or neurological disorder and who have had trouble swallowing for 6 months or longer may be eligible for this study. Patients will undergo a physical examination, pregnancy test, and exam by a throat and speech physician. Fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing involves a flexible tube passed through the nose to the back of the throat to allow observation of the voice box. Videofluoroscopy, an X-ray of the head and neck, will be done while patients swallow. Patients experiencing trouble with the upper esophagus may undergo additional procedures, including manometry to measure pressure changes in the back of the throat, and reevaluation through the fiber-optic tube. Patients in this study will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses a strong magnetic field to obtain images of the body. Patients will lie on a table that slides into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. The scan will take 20 to 25 minutes.

Patients will be assigned randomly to one of two groups: the intramuscular group, to have a stimulation device implanted in the neck, and the vibrotactile group, to receive a vibrotactile stimulator. All patients will have 10 training sessions with their devices, plus follow-up. Those patients in the first group will undergo surgery, under general anesthesia, for the implant. Three weeks following the implant procedure, patients will come to NIH to have the stimulator turned on and programmed and to learn how to use the device. Those patients in the second group will have about 2 to 3 weeks of training in using a vibrotactile device, and then they will take it home to use. All patients will return to NIH at 3 months to ensure proper use of the devices, and they will visit for follow-up at 6 months and 12 months for tests and questionnaires.

NCT02474329,Real-PD Trial: Development of Clinical Prognostic Models for Parkinson's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02474329,,COMPLETED,"Background: Long-term management of Parkinson's disease (PD) does not reach its full potential due to lack of knowledge about disease progression. The Real-PD study aim to evaluate the feasibility and compliance of usage of wearable sensors in PD patients in real life. Moreover, an explorative analysis concerning activity level, medication intake and mood will be done.

Methods: Overall, 1000 PD patients and 250 physiotherapist will be enrolled in this observational study. Dutch PD patients will be recruited across the country and an assessment will be performed using a short version of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) protocol. Moreover, participants will wear a set of medical devices (Pebble Smartwatch, fall detector) and they will use a smartphone with The Fox Insight App (Android app), 24/7, during 13 weeks. Primary measures of interest are: 1) physical activity, falls and tremor, measured by the axial accelerometers embedded in the Pebble watch and fall detector; and 2) medication intake and mood reports measured by patients' self-report in the Android app. To measure motor impact, an assessment will be performed by physiotherapists who are all certified to perform the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS).

Discussion: Management of PD patients is complex and appears to be a challenging task for health care professionals. The main reason is the lack of knowledge in the disease pattern. This issue could be solved by a long term follow-up of patients' during their everyday life, and wearable medical devices can act as a way to collect data about every day life activities. Therefore, the Real-PD study will be a first contribution in increasing the lack of knowledge in disease progression, developing a new medical decision system and improving PD patients' care.",YES,Parkinson's Disease,OTHER: Clinical assessment|DEVICE: Fox Insight self-monitoring android app and falls detector,"Parkinson's Disease Symptoms, The MDS-UPDRS is a revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). It was developed to evaluate various aspects of Parkinson's disease including non-motor and motor experiences of daily living, as well as motor complications. The MDS-UPDRS characterizes the extent and burden of disease across various populations. Here, we used data from one-point assessment (baseline). The total score used here was calculated by a sum of all scores from the 4 sub-scales (i.e. part I, up to part IV) composing the MDS-UPDRS. Total score ranges from 0 to 272. A higher score indicates higher disease severity and burden, being thus a worse outcome., Baseline|Depression Scores as a Measure of Depression Rates, The scores obtained with the Geriatric Depression Scale were analysed in order to create a percentage of probably depressed participants. The total score goes from 0 to 15. A score higher than 6 indicates higher probability of suffer from a depression., Baseline|Cognitive Impairment., Total sum score obtained with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. We analyzed the full score to investigate percentage of participants with a possible cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive sum scores ranges from 0 to 30, in which a score lower or equal to 26 is considered as possible cognitive decline., Baseline|Independency Level, The total sum score obtained with the Schwab and England activities of daily living scale were analyzed to describe the functional level of the sample. The total sum scores varies from 0 to 100, in which lower scores are associated with more dependency of others to perform daily life activities., Baseline","Number of Falls Per Patient Registered by the Falls Detector., The fall event is recognized by the falls detector. Every time that the patient falls, the algorithm embedded at the falls detector recognize as a fall and record the fall event. At the end of the follow-up time, a sum of the falls event for each patient will be done., Patients will be automatically assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|Number of Mood Reports for Each Patient Measured With a Four Point Scale, The number of mood reports will be collected through the smartphone application. A four point scale (very good, good, poor and fair) will be available, and by pressing the button which correspond to how the patient feels at that moment the report can be performed. At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all the reports will be done in order to measure the number of mood reports over the follow-up time., Patients will be assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date). It is expected that the assessment (self-report) will be performed as many times as the patient wants to report how they feel or at least once a day.|Number of Medication Intake Annotations Made by Each Participant Via the Self-report App., The number of medication intake annotations made by the patients will be collected through the smartphone application. Every time that the patient take medication they must press the button reporting that they took the medication. At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all the reports will be done in order to measure the number of medication intake over the follow-up time., Baseline|Time That Each Patient Was Active During the Day, The time that the patient was active during the day is calculated automatically through the app at the smartphone. The calculation is performed by using an algorithm, which analyze the patterns of walk. This algorithm is able to predict when the patient was active in a zone above his/her usual threshold (e.g. when the patient was performing one activity that makes him/her more active than during a quiet time). At the end of the follow-up time a sum of all active hours will be done in order to measure the amount of time that the patient was active over the follow-up time., Patients will be automatically assessed continuously during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The analyses was limited to walking activities.|Level of Activity for Each Patient During the Day, The level of activity for each patient is calculated automatically through the app at the smartphone. The calculation is performed by using the data collect with the accelerometers embedded in the smartwatch. An algorithm installed in the phone, which analyze the data collected with the smartwatch, can calculate the level of activity for each patient throughout the day., Patients will be automatically assessed during the follow-up time (up to 13 weeks after the enrollment date), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|Scores in Autonomic Dysfunctions Measure With the Autonomic Dysfunctions Scale, The scores for autonomic dysfunctions will be obtained with the Assessment of autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (SCOPA-AUT). The total sum scores ranges from 0 to 100, in which high scores are correlated with more burden of autonomic dysfunctions in Parkinson's patients., Baseline|Sleepiness Rates in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale as a Measure of Sleep Quantity., The Epworth sleepiness scale was used to rate the level of sleepiness during the day. The scale's scores are related to the usual duration of sleep at night and increase with relative sleep deprivation. Here, we used data from one-point assessment (baseline). Then, we can suggest that if the sample has high scores they will have a low sleep quantity. Total sum score ranges from 0 (no sleepiness at all) to 24 (excessive sleepiness)., Baseline",,Radboud University Medical Center,Michael J.
