NCT03305809,A Study of LY3154207 in Participants With Dementia Due to Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) Associated With Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (PD) or Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03305809,PRESENCE,COMPLETED,A randomized placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of three doses of study drug LY3154207 treated for 12 weeks in participants with mild-to-moderate dementia associated with LBD (PDD or DLB).,YES,Lewy Body Dementia,DRUG: LY3154207|DRUG: Placebo,"Change From Baseline in the Continuity of Attention (CoA) Composite Score of the Cognitive Drug Research Computerized Cognition Battery (CDR-CCB), The CDR-CCB tests is designed to evaluate the effects of novel compounds on the quality of cognitive functioning which includes tests of attention (simple and choice reaction time, digit vigilance), working memory (spatial and numeric) and episodic memory (word recognition, picture recognition). Continuity of attention measures speed and accuracy and is calculated from 3 attentional tasks on the CDR computerized battery tests. For continuity of attention, the score range is -999 to 35. A high score reflects someone able to keep his/her mind on a single task for a prolonged period. A negative change from baseline reflects impairment compared to baseline. Data presented are model-based bayesian posterior mean response rates with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 12","Change From Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinician Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) Score, The ADCS-CGIC is a validated categorical measure of change in a participant's clinical condition between baseline and follow-up visits; it is used to assess global clinical status. The ADCS CGIC score is based on direct examination of the participant and an interview of the caregiver. The rater should refer to the baseline ADCS-CGIC worksheets in making a rating. A skilled and experienced clinician who is blinded to treatment assignment rates the participant on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening). 1= Very much better 2= Much better 3= A little better 4= Same 5= A little worse 6= Much worse 7= Very much worse. Least squares (LS) means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for treatment + visit + treatment\*visit + age\*acheifl + age + concomitant use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI)., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline on the CDR-CCB Power of Attention (PoA) Composite Score, The PoA is a composite score derived from the CDR-CCB that measures the intensity of concentration (ability to focus attention): the faster the responses, the more processes are being brought to bear upon the task. Power of attention is calculated from the sum of three cognitive function speed tests: simple reaction time, choice reaction time and the speed of detections in digit vigilance task. Score ranges from 450 milliseconds - 61500 milliseconds. A low score reflects a fast reaction time and a high intensity of concentration. A positive change from baseline reflects impairment compared to the baseline assessment Values are calculated by a computer and higher scores mean better outcome. LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total Score + treatment + visit + treatment\*Visit + visit\*baseline total Score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline in the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13), The ADAS is a rater administered instrument that was designed to assess the severity of the dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive behaviors characteristic of persons with AD. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS that was used as the primary efficacy measure consists of 13 items assessing areas of cognitive function most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation. The ADAS--Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total Score + treatment + visit + treatment\*Visit + visit\*baseline total Score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Screening in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Score, The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a screening tool for global cognitive function with a total score ranging from 0 to 30 units on a scale. The MoCA is divided into 7 subscores (maximum possible subscore): visuospatial/executive (5 points), naming (3 points), memory (5 points for delayed recall), attention (6 points), language (3 points), abstraction (2 points) and orientation to time and place (6 points). A score of 26-30 is normal. A score less than 26 is considered as mild cognitive impairment. Higher values represent a better outcome. LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total Score + treatment + visit + treatment\*Visit + visit\*baseline total Score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Screening (Baseline), Week 12|Change From Baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score and Individual Item Scores, The NPI is a condition-specific measure designed to assess neuropsychiatric disturbances in people with Alzheimer Disease (AD),as well as other related dementing disorders.It assesses 12 behavioral disturbances,namely delusions,hallucinations,depression/dysphoria,anxiety,agitation/aggression,elation/euphoria,disinhibition,irritability/lability,apathy, aberrant motor activity, night-time behavior disturbances,and appetite/eating abnormalities.The frequency scored from 0 (never) to 4 (very frequently).The Severity scored from 0 (none) to 3 (marked).The domain score is obtained by multiplying frequency and severity scores.The total NPI score is sum total of all of individual domain scores (0-144).Higher score indiciates more abnormal behaviors.LS means were calculated using mixed model repeated measures adjusting for baseline total score + treatment + visit + treatment\*visit + visit\*baseline total score + age + concomitant use of AChEI., Baseline, Week 12|Change From Baseline in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) Score, The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions.

NCT01023672,"""Pilot Study of Armodafinil in Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies""",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01023672,,COMPLETED,"This research study is to examine the effects of the study medication Armodafinil in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

DLB is associated with memory and other thinking problems, excessive daytime sleepiness, hallucinations, delusions, apathy, and reduced quality of life.

One type of medication that could potentially improve daytime sleepiness, memory and thinking skills, hallucinations, delusions, apathy, and quality of life is known as a wake-promoting medication. Armodafinil is a wake-promoting medication that has been developed for treatment of patients with narcolepsy, sleep apnea, and other disorders which cause excessive daytime sleepiness.

The drug used in this study is considered investigational, which means it has either not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for routine clinical use or for the use described in this study. However the FDA has allowed the use of this drug/device in this research study.

In this study, patients with DLB will receive daily oral Armodafinil tablets, and their response to treatment will be assessed over 12 weeks. This study does not involve any placebo medication, so all patients will receive Armodafinil treatment.",YES,Dementia With Lewy Bodies,DRUG: Armodafinil,"Mean Initial Sleep Latency as Measured by the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (MWT), The MWT measures the subject's ability to stay awake while sitting quietly in a chair. The test has 4 parts, each lasting 40 minutes if the subject is able to remain awake that long each time, and the parts are spaced apart in 2 hour intervals through the day.

The subject is placed in a dim room, with the only source of light slightly behind the subject's head and out of his/her field of vision, and back and neck supported. During this time the subject is monitored with the same measures that are used in a standard overnight sleep study called a polysomnogram. The sleep latency, or time it takes the subject to fall asleep, will be recorded.

In healthy people, the time it takes to fall asleep may be approximately 30 minutes on the test. More than 97% of people will take eight minutes or longer to fall asleep.

The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of neflamapimod on cognitive function as assessed in a study-specific Cogstate Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB). Secondary endpoints include the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10), Timed Up and Go Test, and electroencephalogram (EEG) as a potential biomarker for DLB.",YES,Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB),DRUG: Neflamapimod,"Composite Z-score of a Study-specific Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) Including Tests From Cogstate Battery, Letter Fluency Test and Category Fluency Test, Change from Baseline to Week 4, Week 8, and Week 16 in the composite z-score of a study-specific Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) that included the following six tests: Cogstate Detection test (DET), Cogstate Identification test (IDN), Cogstate One Card Learning test (OCL), Cogstate One Back test (ONB), Letter Fluency Test, and Category Fluency Test (CFT). Each score on the individual tests was converted to a z-score, and then a total z-score for the composite was calculated, in which each test is weighted equally. As the analysis is based on z-scores, there is no minimum or maximum value. A z-score of 0 is equal to the mean with negative numbers indicating values lower than the mean and positive values higher. A positive change in z-score indicate an improvement in cognition, i.e., a better outcome; and a negative change in z-score indicates a worsening in cognition, i.e., a worse outcome., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, all time points at which NTB was assessed utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.","Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Change in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score from Baseline to Week 8 and Week 16 based on semi-quantitative scoring of six domains (i.e., ""box"": 1) memory, 2) orientation, 3) judgement \& reasoning, 4) home \& hobbies, 5) community affairs, and 6) personal care. The CDR score ranges from 0 (no impairment), 0.5 (questionable impairment), 1 (mild impairment), 2 (moderate impairment), and 3 (severe impairment). The domain (box) scores are then added for a Sum of Boxes score. With six domains, the CDR-SB score then ranges from 0 to 18; with higher scores indicated worse outcomes., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which CDR-SB was assessed (week 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a general measure of cognition that assesses orientation, memory, concentration, language, and praxis. Scores range from 0 to 30 with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment, i.e. a worse outcome). The MMSE was assessed at Week 8 and Week 16 during the study., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which MMSE was assessed (week 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10) - Mean Change in Hallucinations Domain Score, The NPI-10 consists evaluates ten domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability/lability, and aberrant motor activity. If caregiver reports symptoms within a domain then the caregiver rates the frequency of the symptoms on a 4-point scale, and severity on a 3-point scale. Total score for each domain is the frequency score multiplied by the severity score; i.e. the domain score (e.g. for hallucinations) for any one domain ranges from 0-12, with higher scores indicating worsening. A secondary objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of neflamapimod in four specific domains, specifically depression (dysphoria), anxiety, hallucinations, and agitation/aggression, in neflamapimod-treated subjects compared to placebo-recipients. Of these four, the only domain in which more than one-quarter of the patients reported symptoms is hallucinations, and the result of this analysis is reported., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, all time points at which NPI-10 was assessed (weeks 4, 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|International Shopping List Test (ISLT) - Immediate Recall, The International Shopping List Test (ISLT) was developed specifically to assess verbal list learning and memory in people from different language and cultural backgrounds. 12 words, consisting to items typically in a grocery shopping list in the specific culture are provided verbally, and subject asked to recall ask many words as possible. The immediate recall score consists of the number of words that the subject correctly repeats during three consecutive trials immediately following provision of words. The range is then from 0 to 36 (12 words maximum in each of 3 trials), with higher scores (i.e., the more words recalled) reflecting better outcomes., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which ISLT was assessed (Weeks 4, 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), The Timed Up and Go test assesses function mobility, and was included in the study to evaluate the effects of neflamapimod on motor function. The TUG measures the time in seconds that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three meters, turn around 180 degrees, walk back to the chair, and sit down while turning 180 degrees. The TUG was evaluated at Baseline, and Weeks 8 and 16 of the study. There is no minimum or maximum value for this test, though in Parkinson's disease patients values above 11.5 seconds was associated with an increased risk of falls and each one second increase in the time required to complete the TUG is associated with a 5.4% increase in the risk of falls (Arch Phys Med Rehabil. 2013;94: 1300-1305). That is, an increase in the time required to complete the TUG is a worse outcome., As the analysis was by Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, both time points at which the TUG was assessed (week 8 and 16) was utilized in the analysis. The difference reported is the mean difference over the entire course of the study.|Quantitative Electroencephalogram (qEEG)m - Dominant Peak Frequency Over Parietal Lobe, Change in quantitative electroencephalogram (qEEG) parameters with the subject awake in accordance with the 10-20 International System of Electrode placement was to be evaluated as a potential biomarker for DLB. However, due to COVID19 related restrictions, baseline and week 16 EEG recordings were obtained only in limited number of subjects. As slowing of the dominant frequency band by qEEG over posterior aspects of the brain has been recognized to be prominent in DLB, the change in the dominant frequency band over the parietal lobe in Hz from baseline to week 16 is reported. This is a continuous variable with no minimum or maximum. A decrease in the frequency (i.e., slowing) reflects worsening of disease, while a positive treatment effect would be an increase in the frequency.

NCT04649164,Learning to PERSEVERE: Peer Mentor Support and Caregiver Education in Lewy Body Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04649164,,COMPLETED,"The investigators propose to adapt, improve, and implement a peer mentor support and caregiver education (PERSEVERE) program to improve LBD-specific caregiving mastery. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is the second most common dementia, comprising Parkinson's Disease (PD) dementia and Dementia with Lewy Bodies. LBD causes deterioration in multiple cognitive, motor, and neuropsychiatric domains, leading to heavy reliance on family caregivers. Patients with LBD are at a far greater risk of hospitalizations for falls, neuro-psychiatric symptoms, and infections, which are often preventable or treatable at home if recognized. Studies cite a crucial need for education and support of LBD caregivers, who face high rates of caregiver strain and adverse outcomes. Evidence from other chronic conditions supports peer mentoring as a potentially effective intervention to provide education and social support. PERSEVERE builds on our team's ongoing work of creating and testing a peer mentoring program for homebound PD patients' caregivers that has shown promising feasibility and acceptability. In the proposed project, the investigators will convene focus groups of former mentors and mentees, along with current caregivers, to provide formative information to shape the revised PERSEVERE curriculum that will include in-person mentor training and a comprehensive mentoring handbook. The curriculum will focus on key areas of LBD caregiving mastery, including: fall prevention, infections, neuropsychiatric symptoms (particularly hallucinations, delusions, anxiety, and depression), and advance directives. The investigators will enroll and train a new cohort of 36 LBD caregiver peer mentors who will be matched with 30 current LBD caregivers. Each pair will be instructed to speak on a weekly basis, using the 16-week structured curriculum as a framework. The study team will support the mentors with monthly conference calls and day-to-day availability for concerns. The investigators will assess the feasibility and fidelity of the intervention via online study diaries tracking the frequency, duration, and content of calls. During mentor training, the investigators will assess the change in mentors' caregiver mastery and LBD knowledge pre- and post-training.

NCT04117178,Monitoring Anti-Dementia Drugs by Serum Levels,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04117178,MONANTI,COMPLETED,"The main objective of the MONANTI study is twofold:

Firstly, to determine the serum concentration (SC) the anti-dementia drugs donepezil and memantine in a broadly defined clinical population of patients suffering from dementia treated with the two drugs in question. Secondly, to determine whether adjustment of treatment of anti-dementia medication based on measurements of the SC will benefit patients in terms of cognitive performance, activities of daily living (ADL), frequency and severity of side effects.

The reason for conduction of this study is that the relationship between serum-level of anti-dementia drugs, clinical efficacy, compliance and side effects has only been scarcely investigated.

Both a previously published study and a preliminary (pilot)study conducted imply that roughly 50 % of patients on donepezil have SC outside the recommended therapeutic reference range (TRR).

Thus, MONANTI will investigate if this is indeed the case in a broadly comprised population of patients with dementia treated with donepezil or memantine. In addition, MONANTI will link SC to co-morbidity, level of compliance, medication interactions. It is hypothesized that the efficacy of anti-dementia drugs can be significantly improved by adjustment of treatment according to SC. Also, it is hypothesized that the burden of side effects can be reduced in patients in whom too high SC are detected, if dose reduction or change of treatment drug is done.

MONANTI is a randomized study, in which the assessor is blinded to avoid related biases to the extent possible.

To meet the enrollment criteria eligible participants must:

A) be newly diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy-bodies or Parkinson's disease with dementia and B) be scheduled for treatment with either donepezil or memantine. C) not meet a list of (exclusion) criteria, which have been set up in order to avoid blur and biases of the results.

D) be able to give written informed consent to participation in presence of a close relative.

After enrollment the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. In the first of these, the control group, the participants receive standard treatment and follow-up at the outpatient clinic. In addition, all participants in the control group who complete the trial will have a blood sample collected at the final visit to measure the SC of the anti-dementia drug along with a genetic test for a few key genes thought to be relevant for the study (two liver enzymes (cyp2D6, cyp3A4/5, APOE-genotype, butyrylcholine-esterase K-variant).

In the other group, the intervention group, the participators will be closely monitored for side effects after prescription of anti-dementia drugs. All participants in the intervention group will be offered a measurement of the SC in case they experience drug side effects within 2 months of treatment initiation. All participants in the intervention group will have a measurement of the SC done at the 6 months visit. The measured SC will be compared to the TRR of the drug in question. This information, along with details from the clinical assessment at the 6 month visit will be used to guide the decision of whether or not to adjust treatment. All decisions on treatment adjustment during the trial are done by the PI according to details in the protocol.

All participants in the intervention group are evaluated again at a 12 month visit, identical to that of the control groups.

To assess the possible effects of SC guided treatment adjustment six clinical tests/rating scales will be used (MMSE, ACE, NPI-Q, DAD, CGI, GDS). The tests/rating scales will be administered both at the enrollement visit and one year later at the final 12 month follow-up visit.

To measure the effect of donepezil on brain cholinergic function approx. 30 participants will be recruited for electroencephalography (EEG). These participants will have an EEG done at enrollment and after 12 months.

In addition to the above mentioned quantitative study a qualitative study with relatives of enrolled participants is planned.

Caregiving of sexual/gender minority older adults with AD/RD is of concern due to social stigma, marginalization, and isolation, which may be barriers to sustaining caregiving. It is necessary and timely to translate evidence-based culturally adaptable interventions for this underserved and stigmatized population. Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD) has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and has shown to successfully train community-dwelling CR (care receiver)-CG dyads to increase the physical activity and functioning of individuals with AD/RD and their CGs and to teach CGs techniques for managing behavioral symptoms of CRs. RDAD consequently decreases stress of CGs, delays institutionalization of CRs, and increases health related quality of life (HRQOL) of CRs and CGs. Thus, this study will evaluate the effect of the standard RDAD among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) CRs with AD/RD and their CGs, and this study will test a personalized intervention tailored to better respond to distinct risks experienced by CGs and LGBT CRs with AD/RD, addressing unique sexual/gender minority CG risk factors (e.g., identity management, stigma-related adverse or traumatic life events, and lack of social support).",YES,Alzheimer Disease|Dementia|Mild Cognitive Impairment|Parkinson Disease Dementia|Lewy Body Dementia|Vascular Dementia,BEHAVIORAL: Innovations in Dementia Empowerment and Action (IDEA)|BEHAVIORAL: Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD),"Change in Physical Activity of Care Recipient, Measured by the days of aerobic activity for at least 30 minutes in the past week with higher numbers indicating more days of activity., Baseline, 6 weeks(pre-treatment), 13 weeks(post-treatment), 30 weeks, 13 months","Depression of Care Partner: Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD-10), Assessed using the summed score on the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD-10).

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.

Relapse was defined as (1) ≥30% increase in SAPS-H+D total score from DB baseline (BL) and CGI-I score ≥6 relative to DB BL, (2) treatment with antipsychotic for dementia-related delusions/hallucinations, (3) treatment/study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy, and/or (4) hospitalization for worsening dementia-related psychosis.

SAPS-H+D is a 20-item scale; the total score is the sum of the 20 item scores (range 0-100); higher scores denote more severe symptoms. CGI-I is a clinician-rated 7-point scale to rate improvement in hallucinations/delusions relative to BL (range 1-7); higher scores denote less improvement or worsening.

A pre-specified IA was conducted after accrual of 40 adjudicated relapse events. The prespecified stopping criterion was met; the study was stopped for efficacy., From randomization in the DB period through 26 weeks","Time From Randomization to Discontinuation From the DB Period for Any Reason, The endpoint of time from randomization to discontinuation from the DB period for any reason (other than termination of the study by the sponsor) was compared between treatment groups using a Cox regression model.
