There are approximately 4,200 Veterans with ALS and roughly 1,000 new cases each year. When doctors attempt to determine the degree to which an ALS patient is suffering from the disease, they apply tests that are ""graded"" by experts. However, this approach to testing patients may not be very accurate. Researchers aim to use a system called DESIPHER to ""listen"" to ALS patients and find speech mistakes related to their condition. Researchers believe that, by detecting different types of errors, DESIPHER serves as a new kind of indicator of medical problems such as difficulty breathing or swallowing, without human ""grading"".

NCT03192358,Physiological Flow of Liquids Used in Dysphagia Management (Neuro),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03192358,,COMPLETED,"For individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Parkinson disease, swallowing impairment (i.e., dysphagia) is a common and serious symptom. Dysphagia places the affected individual at risk for secondary health consequences, including malnutrition and aspiration pneumonia, and negatively affects quality of life.

Thickened liquids are commonly recommended for individuals with dysphagia, as they flow more slowly and reduce the risk of entry into the airway. However, there is limited understanding about how changes in liquid thickness modulate swallowing physiology in individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, and previous reports have shown that increased liquid thickness may contribute to the accumulation of residue in the throat.

The purpose of this study is to explore swallowing physiology and function in individuals with neurodegenerative conditions, across five levels of liquid thickness (thin, slightly-thick, mildly-thick, moderately-thick, and extremely-thick), and to identify boundaries of ""optimal liquid thickness"", which maintain airway safety, without contributing to the accumulation of significant residue. Results from this study will help guide the clinical recommendations for thickened liquids in dysphagia management.",YES,Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis|Parkinson Disease|Dysphagia,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Examination|OTHER: Tongue Strength Measurement,"Number of Participants With Residue of Concern (Observational), Residue is material remaining behind in the pharynx after the swallow. We measured residue by tracing the area of barium visible on a lateral view x-ray (in pixels, using ImageJ software) and dividing that area by the squared length C2-C4 cervical spine. This cervical spine scalar provides a common anatomical reference that is a proxy for pharyngeal size, and enables the comparison of residue severity across different people with different neck length and pharynx size. Smaller values are considered better. The 75th percentile healthy reference values for this measure are 1.7% on thin liquids, 1.9% on slightly thick liquids, 2.2% on mildly thick liquids, 1.6% on moderately thick liquids and 1.5% on extremely thick liquids. Values above these thresholds are considered atypical and of clinical concern. We report the number of participants who display atypical total pharyngeal residue measures per consistency., Single timeframe (baseline only)|Maximum Anterior Isometric Tongue Pressure, Tongue strength was measured using a tongue pressure measurement system called the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI). A small disposable bulb filled with air was placed in the mouth, just behind the front teeth. Participants were asked to press the front of their tongue upwards against the bulb as hard as possible. This task was repeated 3 times. The maximum value obtained across 3 repetitions was recorded as ""maximum anterior isometric pressure"". Higher values represent greater tongue strength. We report group mean values and standard deviations for this measure., Single timeframe (baseline only)|Regular Effort Saliva Swallow Tongue Pressure, Tongue strength was measured using a tongue pressure measurement system called the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI). A small disposable bulb filled with air was placed in the mouth, just behind the front teeth. Participants were asked to swallow their saliva with the bulb in this position. This task was repeated 3 times. The mean value obtained across 3 repetitions was recorded as ""regular effort saliva swallow tongue pressure"". Higher values represent greater tongue strength. We report group mean values and standard deviations for this measure., Single timeframe (baseline only)|Number of Participants With Unsafe Swallows (Observational), Swallowing safety was measured using the 8-point Penetration-Aspiration Scale, an 8-point categorical scale which captures the depth to which any material enters the airway and whether or not the material is ejected. Levels 1 and 2 on the scale are considered safe, while levels \> 2 are considered unsafe. Actual scale scores (1-8) were recorded and then converted to binary categorical scores (\< 3 vs \>/= 3).

Participants were asked to press the back of their tongue upwards against the bulb as hard as possible. This task was repeated 3 times. The maximum value obtained across 3 repetitions was recorded as ""maximum posterior isometric pressure"". Higher values represent greater tongue strength. We report group mean values and standard deviations for this measure. There was no statistical analysis comparing group values for this parameter., Single timeframe (baseline only)|Number of Participants With Multiple Swallows Per Bolus (Observational), The number of swallows needed to clear a single bolus will be counted.

It ranges from a maximum score of 48 for normal functioning to 0 for death or dependance on mechanical ventilation and declines by approximately 1 point per month on average for an ALS patient., 16 weeks|Rate of Decline Handheld Dynamometry (HHD), Efficacy will be assessed by the change in the rate of change of HHD upper and lower extremity mega-scores. HHD utilizes an electronic pressure sensor to measure strength of individual muscles in kilograms. To calculate megascores, the mean and standard deviation of each muscle or muscle group, without regard to laterality, will be calculated from the baseline assessment of all participants. Strength estimates of each bilateral muscle or muscle group will be converted to Z scores by subtracting the relevant mean and dividing by the relevant standard deviation. Z scores for all upper extremity measurements (shoulder flexion, elbow flexion, elbow extension, wrist extension, and first dorsal interosseous contraction) and all lower extremity measurements (hip flexion, knee flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion) will be averaged to yield upper and lower extremity megascores.

NCT01786603,Rasagiline in Subjects With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01786603,,COMPLETED,"ALS is a disorder that weakens motor strength and lung function. Rapid loss of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients causes the symptoms of increasing weakness and loss of muscle function. Motor neurons are responsible for sending signals to muscles in our bodies to trigger movement. While there are drugs to help relieve symptoms of ALS, there is no cure for ALS.

Rasagiline is a drug with possible neuroprotective characteristics. Neuroprotective means that the nervous system may be protected against weakening. It is known that rasagiline has possible neuroprotective characteristics, but the effectiveness of rasagiline for patients with ALS has not been tested. Rasagiline is approved for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Rasagiline for treatment of ALS is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is investigational. Investigational drugs are studied to find out if they are safe and effective in the treatment of diseases or conditions.

By doing this study, researchers hope to learn if rasagiline is safe and slows disease progression in patients with ALS.

The ALSFRS-R consists of 12 questions, assessing a patient's capability and independence in functional activities relevant to ALS, categorized in the following 4 domains: gross motor tasks, fine motor tasks, bulbar functions, and respiratory function. Each question is scored from 0 (indicating incapable or dependent) to 4 (normal). The total score ranges from 0 to 48. Higher scores reflect more normal function and lower scores reflect more impaired function., Baseline to Week 12|Slope of Muscle Strength Mega-score From Baseline to Week 12, A hand-held dynamometer, with a scale of 0 to 300 pounds, was used to measure muscle strength and handgrip strength (bilateral). The muscle groups tested were: elbow flexion, wrist extension, first dorsal interosseous, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion; all muscle groups were evaluated bilaterally. For each postbaseline assessment of muscle strength, the percent change from baseline was calculated for each muscle group and handgrip strength, using the following equation: (\[postbaseline value - baseline value\] / baseline value) × 100. The muscle-strength mega-score was calculated as the average of the changes (ie, percent change from baseline) observed for each of the muscle groups as well as handgrip strength.

NCT03411863,Cervical Electrical Stimulation for ALS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03411863,,COMPLETED,"Veterans are at higher risk than non-Veterans of falling ill with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS causes degeneration of motor neurons in both the brain and the spinal cord. Evidence from studies in people with spinal cord injury suggests that activating spared nerve circuits with electromagnetic stimulation improves nerve transmission.

With this goal, the investigators have developed a novel method of noninvasive cervical (neck) electrical stimulation (CES). In this study, the investigators will investigate CES for its potential to strengthen nerve circuits to the hands in ALS.

To the investigators' knowledge, electrical spinal stimulation for ALS has never been tested previously. This study will be performed in two stages: First, basic experiments will be performed to better understand how CES interacts with other types of electrical and magnetic stimulations over the brain and peripheral nerves. Second, experiments will be performed to determine the types of CES that can facilitate active arm and hand movements.

These experiments will improve understanding of electrical stimulation in ALS, and may set the table for future treatments.

Some people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) have a high level of the virus HERV-K in their blood. Researchers do not think this virus causes ALS. But they don t know why some people with ALS have a high level of it. They want to know if HERV-K can be suppressed by drugs that are used to treat HIV infection.

Objectives:

To learn how drugs usually taken for HIV infection affect people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).

Eligibility:

Adults at least 18 years old with ALS and high levels of HERV-K but no HIV.

Design:

Interested participants can contact the study team and, if eligible, the study team will arrange for a screening blood draw to determine the HERV-K level.

Participants with a high HERV-K level will be screened with medical history, physical exam, questionnaires, nerve conduction test, lumbar puncture, and blood and breathing tests.

After screening, participants will start taking the 4 study drugs.

Participants will have up to 12 study visits over a period of 72 weeks. After starting study drugs, they will have study visits at Weeks 1 and 4 and then every 4 weeks until Week 28. They will be asked how they are feeling and have an exam and blood drawn. At 3 visits, they will have tests of nerve conduction, breathing, and their ALS symptoms.

An additional objective is to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two different doses of AVP-923 in a subset of the study population.

Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) is a condition characterized by involuntary, sudden and frequent episodes of laughing and/or crying out of proportion or incongruous to the underlying emotion of happiness or sadness Other terms used to describe this condition include emotional lability, emotionalism, emotional incontinence, emotional discontrol, excessive emotionalism, and pathological laughing and crying. The outbursts can occur spontaneously or in response to provocative stimuli such as questions or events.

A body of evidence suggests that PBA can be modulated through pharmacologic intervention.

Dextromethorphan (DM) is a low-affinity uncompetitive antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, reducing the level of excitatory activity. DM also acts at the phencyclidine-binding site, which is part of the NMDA receptor complex. DM is a sigma receptor agonist, suppressing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters.

NCT00620698,Electrical Impedance Myography as an Outcome Measure in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Clinical Trials,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00620698,,COMPLETED,"Trials evaluating new therapies for stopping or slowing the progression of ALS depend critically upon the use of outcome measures to assess whether a potential treatment is effective. The more effective an outcome measure, the fewer patients need to be enrolled and the shorter the trial. Many outcome measures have been used over the years, including strength assessments, breathing tests, functional status surveys, and nerve testing, but all are far from ideal. A new method, called electrical impedance myography (EIM) appears to be especially promising in that it provides very consistent data from one testing session to the next, is sensitive to the muscle deterioration that occurs in ALS, and is entirely painless and non-invasive. In this study, investigators from multiple institutions plan to compare several different outcome measures, including EIM, in approximately 120 ALS patients, with each patient being followed for a period of one year. All of these measures will be compared to one another and an assessment of their ability to detect disease progression made.

This protocol is meant for assessing if the addition of TUDCA to the conventional therapy can improve the therapeutic outcome in patients affected by ALS.

Safety will be assessed for all subjects, for the entire duration of the study. 30 patients affected by ALS with site of onset in the limbs will be recruited.

All enrolled subjects will continue receiving riluzole at the same regimen as before entering the trial. Based on an appropriate random code, subjects will be divided into two groups of equal size treated, after a lead-in period of 3 months, by oral route with TUDCA at the dose 2 g daily for 1 year or with identical placebo by oral route at the same dosing schedule, under double-blind conditions.

Every concomitant and/or supportive therapy will be admitted.

Evaluation criteria:

Efficacy. The proportion of responder patients in the two treatment groups was the primary outcome measure of the study. Responder patients were defined as those subjects showing an improvement of at least 15% in the ALSFRS-R (2) slope during the treatment period as compared to the lead-in period. This threshold was chosen based according to the consensus conference on designing and implementing clinical trials in ALS (3).

Other parameters will include ALSFRS-R at study end, FVC%, the SF-36 quality of life rating scale, time to tracheotomy from starting of study medication dosing (if appropriate), survival Time from starting of study medication dosing (if appropriate), Medical Research Council scores for right and left muscle groups.

NCT02781454,Mexiletine in Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02781454,Mexiletine-2,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this research study is to find out whether the drug mexiletine will be effective in lowering motor neuron electrical activity in the brains and nerves in the arms of people with ALS. The investigators will also determine if there are any signs that the drug may slow down the progression of ALS and reduce muscle cramps and muscle twitching. This will be determined through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and threshold tracking nerve conduction studies (TTNCS). In this trial, the participants will be taking either 300mg/day of mexiletine, 600mg/day of mexiletine, or placebo (non-active study drug).",YES,Sporadic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,DRUG: Mexiletine|DRUG: Placebo,"Change in Resting Motor Threshold, The resting motor threshold (RMT) assessed from single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measurements made before treatment, after 4 weeks of treatment, and then again after a 4 week washout, was used as the primary pharmacodynamic marker of cortical hyperexcitability. RMT is the stimulus intensity required to produce and maintain a 0.2 mV peak-to-peak motor evoked potential of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle by TMS. A smaller RMT is thought to suggest greater neuronal excitability., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 and from Week 4 to Week 8 reported","Effect on Short-interval Intracortical Inhibition, Short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) is a measure of neuronal excitability measured by dual pulse TMS with a conditioned (80% of RMT) and test pulses (120% of RMT) to generate a stable MEP amplitude of 0.2 mV, averaged over interstimulus intervals of 1-7 ms. It is thought to reflect refractory cortical axons and subsequent resynchronization of cortico-cortical and corticomotoneuronal volleys or activation of non-GABAergic cortical inhibitory circuits (initial phase) and synaptic neurotransmission through GABAA receptors (second phase). The value for SICI thought to be maximally sensitive for detecting in changes in ALS subjects compared to controls is is derived by measuring the motor evoked potential amplitude (MEP) at an interstimulus interval of 3 ms (ISI 3 ms) and normalizing to the MEP amplitude at 120% of the resting motor threshold (MEP 120% RMT). A reduction in SICI reflecting greater excitability would generate a larger ratio of MEP ISI 3 ms/MEP 120% RMT., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Change in Motor Evoked Potential Amplitude, The motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude is taken from single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and reflects the density of corticomotoneuronal projections onto motor neurons and is affected by cortical hyperexcitability early in ALS where it is thought to be larger than age-matched controls and axonal degeneration later in the disease when it decreases in amplitude. The MEP is most reliable in assessing cortical motor neuronal preservation and excitability when normalized to the peak compound nerve action potential (CMAP) amplitude which reflects the integrity of peripheral motor nerve axons. It is also normalized here to 120% of the RMT to derive a ratio of MEP at 120% RMT/peak CMAP., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Cortical Silent Period, The cortical silent period (CSP) is recorded with single pulse TMS as a duration from the onset of the MEP response to resumption of voluntary electromyography activity with the patient performing a voluntary contraction, set to 30% of maximal voluntary contraction. A shorter CSP compared to controls would reflect greater excitability., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Strength Duration Time Constant, The strength duration time constant (SDTC) is used in threshold tracking nerve axonal excitability studies and is interpreted as a measure of axonal excitability that is dependent upon the biophysical properties of the axonal membrane at the node of Ranvier, especially persistent sodium current. It is derived from the relationship between stimulus duration and intensity. A higher SDTC would reflect greater excitability of motor nerve axons., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Depolarizing Threshold Electrotonus (90-100 ms), Depolarizing threshold electrotonus (90-100 ms) (TEd 90-100 ms) is used in threshold tracking nerve axonal excitability studies in which long-lasting subthreshold depolarizing currents are generated, measured at 90-100 ms following the stimulus. This measure is associated with a decrease in the membrane excitability threshold due to opening of potassium channels on the axonal membrane. Intrinsic changes in axonal excitability properties, such as thought to occur in ALS, could possibly alter this measure, presumably by decreasing TEd 90-100 ms more substantially than normal., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Hyperpolarizing Threshold Electrotonus (90-100 ms), Hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus (90-100 ms) (TEh 90-100 ms) is used in threshold tracking nerve axonal excitability studies in which long-lasting subthreshold hyperpolarizing currents are generated, measured at 90-100 ms following the stimulus. This measure is associated with an increase in the membrane excitability threshold due to closure of potassium channels causing increased resistance of the internodal axonal membrane. Intrinsic changes in axonal excitability properties, such as thought to occur in ALS, could possibly alter this measure., Accessed at Screening, Baseline, Week 4, and Week 8; change from Baseline to Week 4 reported|Effect on Superexcitability, Superexcitability is a component of recovery cycle analysis assessing motor axonal excitability, employing threshold tracking nerve conduction study.
