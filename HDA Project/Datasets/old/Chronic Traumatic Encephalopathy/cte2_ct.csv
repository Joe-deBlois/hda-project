NCT02191267,Tau Imaging of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02191267,,COMPLETED,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative brain disease with symptoms that include memory loss, problems with impulse control, and depression that can lead to suicide. As the disease progresses, it can lead to dementia. Currently CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem where an over-accumulation of a protein called tau is observed. There is now a new experimental measure that makes it possible, for the first time, to measure tau protein in the living human brain using a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, \[F-18\] AV-1451 (aka, \[18F\]-T807).

The main objective of this study is to use a novel PET approach to measure tau accumulation in the brain. The presence of CTE at autopsy in deceased National Football League (NFL) players has been well documented. Accordingly, we will conduct this study in a group of retired NFL players who have clinical symptoms of CTE and are suspected of having CTE based on high levels of tau in their spinal fluid and abnormalities seen on research brain scans. We will compare them with a control group of former elite level athletes who have not experienced any brain trauma, deny any clinical symptoms, and who have completely normal spinal fluid tau and amyloid levels, and brain scans. We will also include a group of subjects with AD. All participants will be recruited from ongoing studies, headed by the Partnering PI of this proposal, Dr. Robert Stern, at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy and the Alzheimer's Disease Center. We will use both a beta amyloid PET scan (\[18F\]-florbetapir) and a tau PET scan (\[18F\]-T807) on consecutive days. With the beta amyloid scan we expect little or no evidence of amyloid in the NFL players with presumed CTE, and no evidence of amyloid in the control group of athletes with no history of repetitive brain trauma. In contrast we expect to see beta amyloid accumulation in the AD patient brains. With the new tau ligand, we expect that the NFL players with presumed CTE will show elevated levels of tau protein in the brain, which will not be observed in athletes without a history of brain trauma, but which will be seen in the AD patients' brains.

Another goal is to use the latest MRI technologies to develop specific tau imaging biomarkers that correlate with the PET and spinal fluid tau measures but without the radiation of PET or invasiveness of spinal taps. The development of these surrogate imaging markers of tau, is critically important to diagnosing CTE. This in turn will lead to studies relevant to treatment and prevention of this devastating disease. Finally, as an exploratory method of examining possible genetic risk for CTE, we will also use cutting edge genetic analysis of blood samples from subjects in this proposal and compare tau load, measured by PET tau ligand uptake and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau level, with a measure of genetic susceptibility to tau load, referred to as the genetic risk score for tau.",YES,Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,RADIATION: [F18]-T807|RADIATION: [F18]-Florbetapir|DEVICE: MRI/MRS|GENETIC: Genetic Analysis for Genetic Risk Score for Tau.,"Tau Protein Uptake.., Whole brain mean (and standard deviation) cortical value derived from standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr).

The rationale for this approach is the ability of central nervous system to repair and the important role of macrophages in the regulation of this process. It was found that type 2 macrophages have anti-inflammatory and reparative potential, whereas M1 cells possess pro-inflammatory and neurotoxic effects. Action of M2 macrophages is largely realized through the production a wide variety of bioactive factors (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, neuropeptides, microvesicles etc) that inhibit inflammation, protect neurons from apoptosis, stimulate neurogenesis, the growth and remyelination of axons, the formation of new synapses and activate angiogenesis.

The proposed CDA-2 program of research will use an innovative translational research approach to study whether a chronic progressive -based exercise program will reduce chronic pain symptoms in patients with varying degrees of PTSD symptom severity and to elucidate and modify potential PTSD-related deficiencies in neurobiological and psychological responses to exercise to optimize the physical and psychological benefits of exercise for these individuals.",YES,Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain|Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)|Mild or Moderate Traumatic Brain Injury,BEHAVIORAL: Exercise Testing and Training,"Change From Baseline: PTSD Checklist-5 (PCL-5), To be administered at: Endpoint Exercise Test Evaluation Session (week 13). The PCL is a 20-item self-report that assesses the extent to which an individual is bothered by each PTSD symptom during the past month using a 5-point Likert-type scale. The PCL-5 is undergoing validation, but the previous PCL based on DSM-IV had good sensitivity (.82) and specificity (.83). Scoring for each item is on a 0-4 scale with higher scores indicating higher symptom severity. A total symptom severity score (range - 0-80) can be obtained by summing the scores for each of the 20 items. Initial research suggests that a PCL-5 cutoff score between 31-33 is indicative of probable PTSD across samples. However, additional research is needed.

Spontaneous blinks are normally incomplete, a behavior that is dependent upon age, gender, task, and environmental demands. Maximum closing was defined as the three points at the base of the blink. Participants were instructed to look at the camera lens and try to relax and behave normally. Recording was stopped after 1 minute or after five spontaneous blinks, whichever came first. Recording always occurred in the same windowless clinical research room with consistent lighting, temperature, humidity, and air flow. The IPF midpoint height during maximum closing in five spontaneous blinks is averaged and reported below., 2 weeks","Interpalpebral Fissure During Resting Open, Resting open IPF was the median between blink-event IPF, measured automatically by a deep learning model for eyelid landmark detection. the IPF midpoint height during resting open was averaged and reported below., 2 weeks|Proportion of Non-closure During Volitional Blinks, At the end of recording, participants were instructed to close their eyes completely and open completely three times, representing volitional blink trials.

NCT00557076,The Efficacy of Familiar Voice Stimulation During Coma Recovery,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00557076,FAST,COMPLETED,"The purpose of the study is to determine whether familiar vocal stimulation, provided during coma recovery, improves outcomes for persons who are unconscious after severe TBI. The primary hypothesis is that unconscious persons who receive standard rehabilitation (SR) plus a high-dose of Familiar Voice stimulation (FVs) compared to unconscious persons who receive SR plus a sham stimulation (Sham Group) will demonstrate:

1. Significantly more neurobehavioral functioning post-intervention compared to pre-intervention.
2. Using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), significantly higher average measures of volumetric activity in the whole brain, middle temporal gyrus bilaterally, primary auditory area, bilateral pre-frontal cortex, hippocampus and/or the cerebellum post-intervention compared to pre-intervention.",YES,Traumatic Brain Injury|Coma|Vegetative State|Minimally Conscious State,BEHAVIORAL: Familiar Auditory Sensory Training|BEHAVIORAL: Sham Auditory Sensory Training,"DOCS Neurobehavioral Measure (DOCS = Disorders of Consciousness Scale) Change, The primary outcome, the DOCS, is a reliable, valid and precise measure of global neurobehavioral functioning shown to remain stable over six weeks.The DOCS-25 starts with a systematic observation followed by administration of 25 sensory stimuli. Best responses to each stimulus are rated on a scale of 0 to 2 and total raw scores range from 0 (worst) to 50 (best). The DOCS change was calculated as the value at endpoint (6 weeks after Baseline) minus the value at Baseline., Baseline and immediately after treatment ends (6 weeks after Baseline)","Coma Near Coma Scale, The CNC scale measures arousal and awareness and test stimuli are administered to elicit a specified behavior. Presence/absence of this behavior is scored as 0, 2 or 4. Total raw scores range from 0 (consistently responsive) to 36 (extreme coma). The CNC change score was calculated as the 8th CNC measure minus the Baseline CNC measure. Since 2 CNC measurements were collected per week, the 8th CNC measure occurred in Week 4. To calculate the change, we used the eighth CNC measure because two patients (one per group) recovered full consciousness after the eighth CNC measure. In the second statistical analysis, all CNC measures were used to calculate the slope; this includes the Baseline CNC and CNC measures 2-8. Again, we used the first 8 CNC measures (instead of all 12 collected over 6 weeks of treatment) because two patients recovered full consciousness after the eighth CNC measure., Baseline and after the 8th CNC assessment (4 weeks after Baseline)",,VA Office of Research and Development,Shirley Ryan AbilityLab|Northwestern Memorial Hospital|Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,21,FED,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",B4951-R,2008-07,2012-03,2012-09,2007-11-12,2014-11-10,2019-06-06,"The Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital, Hines, Illinois, 60141-3030, United States|Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center, Richmond, Virginia, 23249, United States",
