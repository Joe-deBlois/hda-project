A z-score for each test is calculated, which alone can be used to describe relationship between an individual's test score and the mean score of a target population. A z-score of 0 is the mean, and ±1 is 1 standard deviation from the mean. For cUHDRS, z-scores of each test are summed, whereby a higher cUHDRS score is better (score of -3.06-no max value) and a change of ≥1.2 is a meaningful worsening, shown to track functional decline., Weeks 21 for ODC and 69 for NDC|Change From Baseline in the Total Functional Capacity (TFC) Score, Total Functional Capacity (TFC) Scores are reported at Weeks 21 and 69.

The differences in LS mean ( +/-SE) change from baseline SDMT score between the active groups compared with the placebo group at Weeks 21 and 69 were reported. A negative change from baseline in the SDMT indicates disease progression.

The Least Square Mean values of Symbol Digit Modality Test Scores are reported below.

The minimum range for the SDMT scale is 0, indicating highest severity. A max number is not possible as it is a time based task, based on the number of correct answers within a set time frame.

For each participant, a regression line was fitted (Y = a + bx), where b represents the individual slope, reflecting the annualised rate of motor progression. A negative slope suggests improvement or slower decline; a positive slope indicates worsening. To compare treatment efficacy, the slopes were analysed using a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures (MMRM), which accounts for intra-subject variability and missing data. This approach allowed estimation and comparison of average slopes between each treated group and placebo, providing a robust measure of motor function trajectory over time., monthly for eleven months","Efficacy by UHDRS-TFC, Assessed by the rate of change (slope) from V0 to V11 in the UHDRS-TFC.

The response of each participant or means of all participants was evaluated by the slopes of each regression line of UHDRS-TFC determined as follows:

The equation describes the regression line: Y = a + bx, where:

* ""Y"" is the dependent variable.
* ""a"" is the constant that represents the intersection of the line with the vertical axis.
* ""b"" is the angular coefficient, that is, the slope.
* ""x"" is the independent variable. Therefore, the 'b' value represents the slope of the straight line that best fits the values collected from the baseline (V0) to the value of V11, using the least squares method.

The test assesses sustained attention, processing speed, visual scanning, and psychomotor speed, with the total score reflecting the number of correct pairings (out of 110 possible) completed within 90 seconds. Scores range from 0 to 110, with higher scores indicating better cognitive performance., Baseline, Day 84","Change From Baseline in the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) - Independence Scale, The UHDRS is a multi-domain clinical rating scale for assessment of functional capacity in HD. Independence Scale, Part V of the UHDRS, is a single-item measure to assess a participant's ability to function independently in daily activities across all stages of HD. Total score ranges from 10 to 100, with higher scores indicating better functioning. Negative change from baseline indicates worsening in functional ability., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the Trail Making Test Part B, The Trail Making test is a speeded graphomotor test of visual attention and task switching. Part B includes a set-switching component that requires participants to connect a series of alternating numbers and letters in order from lowest to highest (i.e., 1-A-2-B-3-C) in the shortest time possible. The time limit to complete the task is 240 seconds, at which point the test is stopped and scored using the maximum allowable time if not yet completed. Greater time indicates greater impairment. Negative change from baseline indicates less impairment., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS-Mean Latency Until Correct Response), The OTS is a computerized test of executive function to assess problem-solving and planning ability. In this task, participants are shown a set of colored balls and must determine the minimum number of moves required to match a target arrangement by moving one ball at a time into one of two available locations. The goal is to perform the task using the smallest number of moves possible. The participant selects the correct number of moves from the options shown on the screen. The time to correct response is measured. Longer times indicate greater impairment. Negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in performance., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the Paced Tapping Test (PTAP), The PTAP is a test of motor timing in which participants synchronize their finger taps with auditory pacing tones during an initial paced phase. This is followed by a self-paced phase, where the tones are removed, and the participant continues tapping until a final auditory cue signals the end of the test. The primary outcome is paced tapping consistency, calculated as the inverse of the standard deviation of the intertap intervals per millisecond (1/msec), with no range specified. Higher values indicate greater timing accuracy., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the Huntington's Disease Everyday Functioning (Hi-DEF) Home Subdomain Score, Hi-DEF Scale: self-reported measure to capture difficulties experienced in daily life due to HD across 4 areas of functioning: At home, At work, Driving, \& Relationships. Full scale comprises 40 items which ask participants to rate their functioning difficulty using 5-point Likert scale from 1 (No Difficulty) to 5 (Cannot do this anymore) on first 3 domains (home, work \& driving), \& 4-point scale from 1 (Never) to 4 (Always)for Relationships. Hi-DEF total score ranges from 0-154, higher score=greater difficulty. For Home subdomain, before scores can be calculated, data from item responses should be rescored so as: lowest item-level score=0 \& highest item-level score= 4. Hence, Home subdomain has 15 items scored on 5-point Likert scale, 0 indicating no difficulty \& 4 indicating cannot be done anymore, where total raw score of 0-60 are transformed to 0-100. Higher score=greater difficulty. Negative change from baseline=improvement in daily functioning., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) Cognitive Status Subdomain Score, The CGI-S scale is a validated instrument developed by the National Institute of Mental Health specifically for use in clinical studies. Cognitive Status Subdomain is one of clinical global impression severity scales domains, for which clinicians generate ratings of the severity of the participant's condition over the past 7 days (including the day of the clinic visit). The responses are scored on a scale ranging from 0 (normal - no symptoms present) to 6 (severely disabled; helpless; complete assistance needed).
