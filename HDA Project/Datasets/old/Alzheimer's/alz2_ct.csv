The most common type of dementia (55%) is Alzheimer's dementia, and vascular dementia is the second commonest type (15%). Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) affects up to 20% of older adults and describes a set of symptoms rather than a specific medical condition or disease. A person with MCI has subtle problems with one or more of the following: day-to-day memory, concentrating, planning or organising, language (eg struggling to find the right word), and judging distances and seeing objects properly. Although MCI significantly increases the risk of developing dementia (by up to 5 times), at present it is not possible to accurately predict which patients with MCI will progress to dementia. In recent times there has been an increasing awareness that problems with brain blood flow may contribute to the development, or progression, of dementia. Tests of mental abilities, with standardised questions and pen-and-paper tests are a key component of the formal diagnosis of dementia, yet little is known of the effects of these tests on brain blood flow. Brain blood flow can be can be assessed non-invasively by the use of Trans Cranial Doppler (TCD). This means using ultrasound probes over both sides of the head to measure changes in blood flow in one of the main brain arteries (the middle cerebral artery). This proposed study will therefore use TCD to evaluate changes in brain blood flow during performance of the Addenbrooke's-III (ACE-III) cognitive assessment in four key groups of patients, specifically:

NCT03602391,The Senior Companion Program Plus,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03602391,SCP Plus,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) is one of the most challenging chronic health conditions in the United States and considerable disparities exist in the diagnosis and prevalence of ADRD among communities of color. Research suggests that ADRD caregiver interventions have demonstrated efficacy, however, it remains unknown whether existing ADRD caregiver interventions are useful or accessible to African American ADRD caregivers in community settings.

The primary goal of the proposed project is to develop an in-home psychoeducational intervention (The Senior Companion Program Plus, or SCP Plus) that is accessible, sustainable, and affordable for African American ADRD caregivers. The SCP Plus will focus on African American ADRD caregivers who are particularly affected by poverty, discrimination, and barriers to health care services and supports. A recent pilot study has established the feasibility and utility of SCP Plus. With the assistance of 6 student research assistants over the course of the project, we will implement the SCP Plus at sites in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, recruiting approximately 114 participants. The participants will be randomized with 57 caregivers receiving the SCP Plus and 57 caregivers receiving services as usual with the Senior Companion Program. A weekly, 60 minute psychoeducational module will be delivered face-to-face across 9 weeks and will focus on education about ADRD, behavior management, communication skills, and aspects of providing care that enhance meaning such as spirituality. In order to provide an accessible and cost effective intervention that is potentially sustainable, senior companions will be trained to provide the intervention in the homes of the African American ADRD caregivers.

Specific Aim 1. Determine whether SCP Plus reduces level of burden and stress among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.

Specific Aim 2. Ascertain if SCP Plus improves coping skills among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6-month period when compared to a usual care control group.

Specific Aim 3. Examine whether SCP Plus improves the level of satisfaction with support social among African American caregivers over a 3- and 6- month period when compared to a usual care control group.

Specific Aim 4. Explore and interpret the statistical results obtained in the first quantitative phase to help explain why participants who scored in the lower and upper quartiles on caregiver burden/stress were impacted or not by the usefulness of the intervention.

Successful design, delivery, and evaluation of the SCP Plus will lead to a cost effective, sustainable, and accessible intervention that can be implemented in other Senior Companion programs across the country, thus maximizing its impact as a community-based program to address the needs of African American ADRD caregivers.",YES,Family|Alzheimer Dementia,BEHAVIORAL: SCP Plus,"Change in Caregiver Burden and Stress, The 22-item version of the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) will be used to test caregiver stress and/or burden.

NCT02292238,Benfotiamine in Alzheimer's Disease: A Pilot Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02292238,Benfotiamine,COMPLETED,"General Investigational Plan

Study Objectives The goal of this proposal is to determine whether enhancing brain glucose utilization minimizes cognitive decline in patients with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (AMCI) or mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. We propose a proof of concept double-blind, placebo controlled pilot study to determine if increasing brain thiamine availability with the investigational new drug benfotiamine, will minimize the decline in glucose utilization and slow the cognitive decline associated with the progression AMCI/AD dementia.

Specifically, our objectives are two-fold:

* To test whether increasing brain thiamine by administering 600 mg per day (300 mg/morning and 300 mg/evening) of benfotiamine for one year can slow cognitive decline in these patients as measured with the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-COG).
* To determine whether increasing brain thiamine availability with 600 mg (300 mg/morning and 300 mg/evening) per day of benfotiamine for one year can slow the decline in brain glucose metabolism in these patients as measured with Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography(FGPET) in the posterior cingulate.

We will also carry out the following secondary objectives:

* Assess if there are differences in secondary clinical outcome measures (NPI, ADCSADL, CDR, Buschke) between benfotiamine and placebo groups and whether specific cognitive domains (ie: activities of daily living, learning and memory verbal memory, behavioral, etc.) are driving these changes.
* Compare ADAS-COG change scores in the benfotiamine and placebo groups within and between strata that were defined by initial cognitive impairment, to attempt to identified the population that most benefits from benfotiamine.
* Compare changes in glucose utilization between the benfotiamine and placebo groups in secondary Regions of Interest (ROIs) including the hippocampus, prefrontal regions and entorhinal cortex.
* Compare changes in whole brain glucose utilization between the benfotiamine and placebo groups using statistical parametric mapping (SPM).
* Assess the correlation between changes in glucose utilization with changes in ADAS Cog.
* Determine if ApoE4 genotype alters the response to benfotiamine.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: Benfotiamine,"Change From Baseline in ADAS-Cog Score, The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) is a brief neuropsychological assessment used to assess the severity of cognitive symptoms of dementia. It is one of the most widely used cognitive scales in clinical trials and is considered to be the ""gold standard"" for assessing antidementia treatments. The ADAS-Cog range from 0 to 70, where higher scores indicate greater cognitive dysfunction., Baseline, 1 year","Change From Baseline in Brain Glucose Utilization, The AAL (Automatic Anatomical Labeling) atlas provides the taxonomy for 116 regions of interest, 90 of which capture non-cerebellar cortical regions. Signal averages from 9 cerebellar regions from each hemisphere were further averaged into one composite cerebellar region for each hemisphere, 'Cerebellum\_L' and 'Cerebellum\_R', which were comprised of the respective laterality averages of the regions: 'Cerebellum\_Crus1 ' 'Cerebellum\_Crus2 'Cerebellum\_3' 'Cerebellum\_4\_5' 'Cerebellum\_6' 'Cerebellum\_7b' 'Cerebellum\_8' 'Cerebellum\_9' 'Cerebellum\_10 '. Subsequently, these two composite regions are further combined with the bilateral paracentral lobules to provide one final composite for reference scaling. Concretely, the values from 'Cerebellum\_L', 'Cerebellum\_R', 'Paracentral\_Lobule\_L', and 'Paracentra\_Lobule\_R' were averaged. This final composite will serve as the denominator for the scaling operation of any ROI value prior to group-level analysis., Baseline, 1 year|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Score, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) is a caregiver-based Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale composed of 23 items developed for use in dementia clinical studies. It was designed to assess the patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score is 0 to 78. Higher scores equate with higher functioning., Baseline, 1 year|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, The NPI assesses a wide range of behaviors encountered in dementia patients to provide a means of distinguishing frequency and severity of behavioral changes. Ten behavioral and two neuro-vegetative domains are evaluated through an interview with the caregiver. The total score ranges from 0 to 144. Higher scores suggest greater psychiatric impairment., Baseline, 1 year|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Score, The CDR was developed primarily for use in persons with dementia of the Alzheimer type (the equivalent of probable Alzheimer's Disease) and can also be used to stage dementia in other illnesses as well. The scores for the multiple items are summarized in one score. The CDR examines 6 categories of cognitive functioning domains. Each domain is scored on a scale ranging from 0 to 3 (including 0.5). A CDR-SB was generated as the sum of the values in each of the 6 domains. The CDR-SB sum scores range from 0 to 18, with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment and a 1 point worsening is considered a clinically significant symptom change., Baseline, 1 year|Change From Baseline in Buschke Selective Reminding Test (SRT) Score, The SRT is a standard diagnostic tool in the assessment of verbal memory. The Buschke SRT immediate total scores are compared between treated (benfotiamine) and control (placebo) groups. The immediate total score is the sum of correct responses over the 6 learning trials with scores ranging from 0 to 72. A score of 0 means severe impairment in memory. A score of 72 means there is no impairment in memory. For the purpose of determining effect over several trials between groups, the fractional change from the baseline of each group is compared., Baseline, 1 year",,Burke Medical Research Institute,Burke Rehabilitation Hospital|Columbia University|National Institute on Aging (NIA)|Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation|Montefiore Medical Center,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,71,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",BRC-451|1R01AG043679-01A1,2015-02-15,2020-07-20,2020-09-08,2014-11-17,2022-06-28,2022-06-28,"Burke, White Plains, New York, 10605, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/38/NCT02292238/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

NCT01703117,Riluzole in Mild Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01703117,,COMPLETED,"Cognitive aging is a major source of disability in an increasingly aging population. The paucity of effective treatments for cognitive aging disorders, and most importantly in Alzheimer's disease instigates a need for further research into novel therapeutic possibilities. Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disorder and its prevalence steeply increases. Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in neuropsychiatric disorders and in particular in Alzheimer's disease has been shown to cause significant cerebral damage. Early effective therapeutic intervention in Alzheimer's disease is critical in order to prevent or at least slow down neuropathological progression that will lead to widespread irreversible neuronal loss and significant cognitive dysfunction. Riluzole, a glutamate modulator agent, will be tested in mild Alzheimer's disease patients. Cognitive functional changes along with two established in vivo biomarkers, namely, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) and Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F) positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) will be evaluated.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: Riluzole|DRUG: Placebo,"Imaging Biomarkers FDG-PET SUVR in Regions of Interest, Change from baseline to 6 months in cerebral glucose metabolism measured with FDG PET in posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, precuneus, and medial temporal, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, and frontal lobes, referred to collectively as our pre-specified regions of interest.

Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging procedure that measures glucose metabolism in the brain.It is a well-established Alzheimer's disease biomarker and predictor of disease progression. For each FDG PET scan, 5 mCi of fluorodeoxyglucose was administered followed by a 40 minute uptake period during which the participant was in a resting state. Images were acquired on a Siemens Biograph 64mCT scanner as a series of 4 frames of 5 minutes each.

NCT03856359,Trial of Rifaximin in Probable Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03856359,,COMPLETED,"This study aims to improve cognition and function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) by administering the oral antibiotic, Rifaximin.

Rifaximin is a virtually non-absorbed antibiotic with the unique properties of lowering blood ammonia levels and altering gut microbiota. It is FDA approved for use in patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Rifaximin lowers blood ammonia by altering fecal flora by blocking bacterial RNA synthesis and also by increasing small bowel glutaminase. The Investigators hypothesize that rifaximin will improve cognition and function in AD patients by lowering blood ammonia and / or lowering circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted by harmful gut bacteria. The Investigators will enroll up to 10 subjects with probable middle stage Alzheimer's Disease. The subjects will be given rifaximin 550 mg orally twice daily for 3 months after evaluation to ensure they have no contraindications. Physician clinical and safety assessments, adverse events, as well as the ADAS-Cog-11 will be administered at baseline and at the 3 month endpoint and two months after stopping treatment (at month 5). Interim safety checks will occur via phone calls one week after baseline and then every 2 weeks till end point. Serum neuronal biomarkers, ammonia levels and pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory compounds will also be measured at those times. Bodily fluids (Stool samples) will also be collected. Because of a small risk of developing C. difficile up to 2 months following the last administration of rifaximin, the subjects will be followed for an additional 2 months after the 3 month treatment ends.

Rifaximin is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to rifaximin or rifamycin antimicrobials. Hypersensitivity reactions include exfoliative dermatitis, angioneurotic edema, and anaphylaxis. Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea is a risk whenever a patient is maintained chronically on antibiotics, with complications ranging from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Drug resistant bacteria can also result from long term use. There is increased systemic exposure to rifaximin in patients with severe hepatic impairment or in patients who are taking P-glycoprotein inhibitors concomitantly.

A recent study reported that monthly and weekly consumption of red wine is associated with a lower risk of dementia. There is compelling evidence that caloric restriction can improve overall health by activating a class of enzymes known as Sirtuins. Resveratrol is a substance found in some plants that directly activates sirtuins, mimicking the effects of caloric restriction and may affect regulatory pathways of diseases of aging, including Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In this study, people with AD will be given either Resveratrol or placebo for 12 months to determine whether daily resveratrol therapy is beneficial in delaying or altering the deterioration of memory and daily functioning. Subjects age 50 and above with a diagnosis of probable AD may qualify for participation in this study.

During 13C6-leucine infusion, 13C6-leucine is incorporated into newly synthesized proteins throughout the body, including the brain, in proportion to the available 13C6-leucine. This FSR is calculated as the rate of change of the ratio of 13C6-leucine-labeled Aβ proteins to unlabeled Aβ proteins in the lumbar CSF between 6 to 16 hours, normalized to the ratio of labeled to unlabeled leucine amino acid in plasma. It is reported as a fraction of 13C6-leucine-labeled to unlabeled Aβ proteins per hour.

The total score ranges from 0 (worst) to 30 (best performance). Results of the MMSE for this trial were reported as a raw change score, calculated as the change between the total scores at two evaluation time points (Baseline, Pre-Confinement Visit) and where negative values are worse and positive values are better., MMSE was administered at Baseline and at the Pre-Confinement Visit 1-3 days prior to the Confinement Visit. This confinement visit occurred following 21-23 days of treatment with either Posiphen or placebo, while also allowing a +/- 2-day visit window.|Assessment of Neuropsychiatric Effects, The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to measure the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms. On this scale frequency ratings range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very frequently, once or more per day or continuously). Severity ratings range from 0 (no severity) to 3 (severe). The score for each of 12 symptoms measured in the scale is the product of severity and frequency within that symptom. The total score for the NPI is the sum of all 12 symptom item scores, for a highest possible total score of 144 in individuals with maximal symptoms, and a lowest possible total score of zero (0) in fully asymptomatic individuals. Lower scores are better and higher scores indicate more neuropsychiatric symptoms. Results are calculated as the change between the total scores at two evaluation time points (Baseline, Pre-Confinement Visit) with negative scores being better and positive scores being worse., NPI was administered at Baseline and at the Pre-Confinement Visit 1-3 days prior to the Confinement Visit.

Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS) is a scale to measure specific cognitive and behavior disorders in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients. The Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) provides a total score range 0-70, and consists of 11 items with lower score indicating lighter impairment and higher total scores indicating more impairment. A negative change score indicates improvement from baseline. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16","Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Score, ADCS-ADL is a scale based on caregiver's assessment of patient's activities of daily life. It is used in clinical studies on dementia \& consists of 23 items and is designed to assess patient's basic \& instrumental activities of daily life, such as the abilities necessary for personal care, communicating \& interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies \& interests, \& making judgments \& decisions. Response to each item is obtained by interview with the caregiver. The basic activities of daily life domain includes mandatory options for best response, or ""yes"" or ""no"" questions with separate sub-questions. Higher score \& more ""yes"" answers indicate better level of self-care of patient. Therefore the higher the total score is, the better the patient's functions. The total score is the sum of the scores of all the items \& sub-questions,\& ranges from 0 to 78. Two-sided 95% CI of the difference in the means between baseline and post-baseline values were calculated., Baseline, Week 16|Change From Baseline in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), MMSE was used to determine patient's eligibility to participate, is an easy \& practical screening test to identify cognitive disorders. Test consists of 2 parts: language (time orientation, registration \& attention) \& performance (recall, response to written/verbal commands, writing ability \& reproduction of complex polygons); total score range: 0-30; higher score = better function. Positive change score = improvement from baseline. To meet eligibility criteria, patient's MMSE total score at screening had to be 10-26 (inclusive). Interpretation of MMSE by 4 methods: Single Cut0ff: \<24=abnormal; Range: \<21=Increased odds of dementia; \>25=Decreased odds of dementia; Education: 21- abnormal for 8th grade education, \<23=abnormal for high school education, \<24=abnormal for college education; Severity: 24-30=no cognitive impairment, 18-23=mild cognitive impairment, 0-17=severe cognitive impairment. 2-sided 95% CI of difference in means between baseline \& post-baseline values were calculated, Baseline, Week 16|Mean Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, This scale assesses a larger scope of the behavior problems/disorders experienced in dementia patients, and identifies the frequency \& severity of the behavior disorders, \& allows rapid assessment using screening questions. 10 questions in behavior domain \& 2 in autonomic nervous system domain were assessed by the investigator interviewing with the caregiver. The NPI-12 total score is the total score of the 12 items, among which the score for each domain is the product of frequency (range: 1-4 points) and severity (range: 1-3 points). The highest score for each domain is 12 points and all the domains have the same weight. Therefore the range of NPI-12 total score is 0-144 points. The NPI-10 total score is the total score of the first 10 items 0-120, which constitute the original form of this scale. A higher NPI total score indicates more severe behavior disorder.

Each item is scored on a 5-point scale based on the intensity of burden (0-4 points), so that the total score is 0-96, a higher score indicating heavier burden. It is a self-administered scale that takes about 10-15 minutes to complete.

At each time point, a ratio of the PET reading in a pre-defined region of interest (sROI), known to be affected by AD, and in a reference region (RR) that is spared in AD, is determined. This ratio is defined as ""sROI index"" (spared region). A second RR, brain white matter (WM), was also used in this calculation: sROI index"" (WM) value. delta sROI is defined as change in the sROI index values, over the treatment period. In this study we are looking for changes in delta sROI with increasing doses of T3D-959. Dose dependent changes in delta sROI (AD spared) are compared to those observed with the WM as the RR: delta sROI (WM).

BOLD fMRI has been used in cross sectional and longitudinal studies of Alzheimer's subjects, for instance in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative studies. However, no studies monitoring Default Mode Networks measured parameters such as GoF, in the context of an effective AD therapeutic, as a result it is difficult to interpret the observed small changes listed in BOLD fMRI parameters obtained in this trial.

NCT00762411,"Effects of LY450139, on the Progression of Alzheimer's Disease as Compared With Placebo",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00762411,IDENTITY-2,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal degenerative disease of the brain for which there is no cure. AD causes brain cells to die. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta amyloid (β-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. At autopsy, AD patients are required to have these amyloid plaques in the brain in order to have a definitive diagnosis of AD. Inhibiting the enzyme gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) lowers the production of β-amyloid. Semagacestat (LY450139) is a functional γ-secretase inhibitor and was shown to lower β-amyloid in blood and spinal fluid in humans tested thus far and in blood, spinal fluid and brain in animals tested thus far. This study used several different tests to measure the effect of semagacestat on both β-amyloid and amyloid plaques for some patients. The buildup of amyloid plaques was measured by a brain scan that takes a picture of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other tests measured the overall function of the brain and brain size in some patients. In this trial, patients who initially received placebo (inactive sugar pill) were, at a certain point in the study, switched over to active drug, semagacestat. In other words, all patients could eventually receive active drug. Each patient's participation could last approximately 2 years. Patients taking approved AD medications were permitted to participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study. All patients who completed this study had the option to continue receiving semagacestat by participating in an open label study.

Preliminary results from this study (LFBC) (and another similar study LFAN \[NCT00594568\]) showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. LFBC, LFAN and open label LFBF (NCT01035138) have been amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores, for at least seven months.

NCT01617577,Efficacy and Safety of Filgrastim in Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01617577,FFAD,COMPLETED,"Filgrastim (G-CSF) is widely used for treatment of patients who have a deficiency of white blood cells. It is also routinely used to stimulate and mobilize stem/progenitor cells for bone marrow transplantation. In studies of thousands of healthy donor subjects treated with G-CSF, the side-effects profile has been reported to be mild and reversible. Currently, G-CSF is under investigation in clinical trials in Germany and the US that aim to enhance recovery from strokes and heart attacks. In animal studies, G-CSF has been observed to improve cognitive performance and to markedly reduce amyloid deposition in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in a mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since this drug is being used safely in many people throughout the world, the investigators hypothesize that it will also be safe to give to patients with Alzheimer's disease and that it may improve some aspects of memory and thinking. The present pilot study has two goals or objectives: 1) to investigate the effects of a five day schedule of Filgrastim administration on cognitive function and 2) to assess its tolerability and safety in a small group (12 patients) with mild to moderate stage AD. Patients who are eligible for the study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups (n=6 per group). One group will receive a five-day course of Filgrastim injections and the other group of subjects will receive vehicle injections (solution without drug). At the end of the first phase of the study (week 8), the groups will cross over to receive either vehicle or Filgrastim as appropriate. In this way all subjects will have received the active medication by the end of the study. After the study is finished the investigators should know whether or not Filgrastim improves some aspects of thinking and memory.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) was performed. The functional HCI was derived from the MTL network using a data driven approach corresponding voxel time courses from the fMR images were processed to extract low frequency fluctuations. Functional connectivity was quantified by calculating the cross-correlation of each voxel time course in the hippocampus to all voxel time courses of the whole brain and the mean of absolute cross-correlation coefficients between a hippocampus voxel to the whole-brain voxels. HCI was then calculated as the average of all hippocampus cross-correlation coefficients. Change from baseline (CFB) was calculated using the CBF-Perfusion Processing Method. A positive change from baseline for HCI indicates improved function., Week 12","Change From Baseline at Week 12 in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Scale (ADAS)-Cog Score, The ADAS-cog is a 13-item performance-based test that examines selected aspects of cognition including memory, orientation, attention, reasoning, language, and praxis. Total score ranges from 0 to 70 with higher scores indicating greater cognitive impairment. A decrease from baseline indicates improved cognitive function. The ADAS-cog was administered by a trained individual unaware of adverse events reported during this trial., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline at Week 12 in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score, MMSE was a 11-item scale to measure cognitive status where a higher score indicated better cognitive state. The score ranged from 0 to 30, with a higher score indicating better function. A positive change score indicated improvement from baseline. The mean change was analyzed by Wilcoxon's signed rank test., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline at Week 12 in the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Assessment Score, IADL Scale measures 7 areas of more complex activities required for optimal independent functioning, as reported by the caregiver. The scoring indicates whether the participant was completely independent (3), requires assistance (2), or is dependent (1) for the performance of each activity. A summary score ranges from 7 (high function, independent) to 21 (low function, dependent). The mean change was analyzed by Wilcoxon's signed rank test. A decrease from Baseline to Week 12 indicates improved function., Baseline and Week 12|Change From Baseline at Week 12 in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Score, NPI was a 12-item caregiver-based assessment of behavioral disturbances commonly occurring in participants with AD. NPI includes 12 sections which are Delusions, Hallucinations, Agitation, Depression, Anxiety, Euphoria, Apathy, Disinhibition, Irritability, Aberrant motor behavior, Night-time behaviors and Appetite and eating disorders. The score of each section ranges from 0 to 12, and higher score means higher severity and frequency of the neuropsychiatric disturbances.

Using a structured interview format, study partners are queried as to whether participants attempted each item in the inventory during the past 4 weeks and their level of performance. The ADCS-ADL provides a total score from 0-78, with a lower score indicating greater severity. We calculated change by subtracting scores on week 24 test from the baseline score. A negative score indicates worsening ability to complete ADLs., Mean change in scores from baseline to week 24|Change in NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory) Score, Measure Description: The behavioral outcome measure for this trial is the NPI (Neuropsychiatric Inventory). The NPI evaluates both the frequency and severity of 10 neuropsychiatric disturbances. Frequency assessments range from 1 (occasionally, less than once per week) to 4 (very frequently, once or more per day or continuously) as well as severity (1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe). The overall score is calculated by summing the severity and frequency of the subscale measures. The range of scores is 0-40. A score of 0 indicates no behavioral impairment and a score of 40 indicates severe behavioral impairment. We calculated change by subtracting Week 24 scores from baseline scores. A positive change indicates behavioral worsening., Mean change in scores from baseline to week 24|Change in Digit Span, Measure Description: The Digit Span consists of repetition of increasing long strings of digits presented at 1 per second as read by the examiner and repeated by the subject.The score is the maximum number of digits the patient can repeat until they fail twice in a row. The reverse digit span is identical to the forward digit span except that the patient repeats the presented digits in reverse order. The score is the maximum number of digits the patient can repeat in reverse order until they fail twice in a row. Each correct response is worth one point with a maximum total score of 28. A higher score is better. We calculated change by subtracting week 24 score from baseline score. A negative score indicates worse performance over the course of study., Mean change in scores from baseline to week 24|Change in COWAT (Controlled Oral Word Association Test) Score, Measure Description: Study participants are instructed, ""I want to see how many words you can say beginning with a certain letter in one minute."" The study participant's responses are recorded on the worksheet. Study participants are then given an additional one minute for each of two different letters using similar instructions. The score is the total number of acceptable words for the three trials combined. A higher score represents better performance.

Responses are then judged for their acceptability (example for the use of proper nouns, numbers, repetitions and stem word with a different ending). The score is the total number of acceptable words for the three trials combined. A higher score represents better performance. We calculated change by subtracting week 24 scores from baseline scores.

Lower score indicated more impairment., At Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12|Change From Baseline in Modified Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Severe Scale (ADCS-ADL) Total Score, ADCS-ADL is a comprehensive battery of ADL questions used to measure a participant's functional capabilities. The modified ADCS-ADL-severe scale is a 19-item scale that has been validated for the assessment of participants with moderate to severe dementia. It measured the most appropriate basic and instrumental abilities (such as walking, grooming, bathing, and eating) in this participant population. Response to each item was obtained by interview with the caregiver. Ratings reflected caregiver observations about the participant's actual functioning and provided an assessment of change in the functional state of the participant over time. The total score ranged from 0 to 54. Lower scores indicated greater functional impairment., At Baseline, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12|Change From Baseline in Quality of Life-Alzheimer's Disease (Qol-AD) Total Score, QoL-AD is a 13-item quality of life instrument developed to specifically assess QoL in participants who have dementia. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale (poor, fair, good, excellent) and a single score was calculated, ranging from 13 (low functioning) to 52 (normal function). Higher score indicated better QoL. The QoL-AD total scores for the participants and caregiver were the sum of the 13 items on each test., At Baseline, Month 6 and Month 12|Change From Baseline in European Quality of Life-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Total Score, EQ-5D is a health profile questionnaire assessing quality of life along 5 domains. Caregivers rated 5 domains of health (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) by choosing from 3 answering options (1=no problems; 2=some problems; 3=extreme problems). The EQ-5D Health Utilities Index (HUI) is derived from the five dimensions of the EQ-5D, using country-specific preference weights (tariffs) to summarize how good or bad each health state is on a scale from 1 to 0. HSI total score ranged from 1 (full health) and 0 (worst health/death)., At Baseline, Month 6 and Month 12|Change From Baseline in Screen for Caregiver Objective Burden (SCB) Total Score, The SCB is a 25-item instrument that questions caregivers about the occurrence and degree of distress as aspects of the burden of care during the preceding two weeks. It was designed specifically for use with caregivers of Alzheimer's disease participants. Each item was assessed on a 5-point scale ranging from ""0"" (no occurrence) to ""4"" (occurrence with severe distress). The objective burden was the sum of the total numbers of (1 2 3 4) in all items. Total score ranged from 0 (low distress) to 100 (high distress)., At Baseline, Month 6 and Month 12|Change From Baseline in Screen for Caregiver Subjective Burden (SCB) Total Score, The SCB is a 25-item instrument that questioned caregivers about the occurrence and degree of distress as aspects of the burden of care during the preceding two weeks. It was designed specifically for use with caregivers of Alzheimer's disease participants. Each item was assessed on a 5-point scale ranging from ""0"" (no occurrence) to ""4"" (occurrence with severe distress). The subjective burden was the sum of the (total number with score\*score). Total score ranged from 0 (no occurrence) to 100 (occurrence with severe distress)., At Baseline, Month 6 and Month 12|Number of Participants With Treatment Outcome Scale (TOS) Score, TOS is a pilot instrument designed to evaluate the caregiver's assessment of the participant's status. The caregiver was asked how much he/she thinks the participant has been helped by participating in the study. This instrument comprised a 7-point Likert scale in which a rating of 1=Very much improved; 2=Moderately improved; 3=Minimally improved; 4=About the same; 5=Minimally worse; 6=Moderately worse; 7=Very much worse. The total scale ranged from 1 (marked improvement) to 7 (marked worsening)., At Months 6 and 12|Goal Attainment Scaling (GAtS) Score Total Score, GAtS is a technique that is standardized with respect to the general approach, but individualized with respect to the outcome goals of each participant. GAtS was designed to provide insight into the changes that are considered as important by the caregiver and (if feasible) by the participants. At study initiation, the participants (if capable) and, separately, the caregiver were asked to specify up to 4 goals for the participants during study participation. For each goal, a description of the current state (or one supplied with the help of the clinician if necessary) was provided to anchor the baseline assessment at 0, and other possible outcomes were described. The outcome for each goal was quantified by a 4-point scale that provided for improvement (+1, +2), no change (0) or worsening (-1, -2). Total score ranged from -30 (worsened) to 130 (most improved).

Compared to the general population, Veterans have a greater risk of AD, likely in part due to their increased incidence of traumatic brain injury, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and other vascular-related health issues. Based on available data, 423,000 new cases of AD are anticipated in Veterans by 2020. Thus, the discovery of effective therapies to prevent or delay the onset of AD in Veterans is critical. The goal of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a purified form of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) called icosapent ethyl (IPE), on improving brain blood flow, spinal fluid markers of AD pathology, and cognitive performance in middle-aged, cognitively-healthy Veterans with increased risk of AD.

NCT02002819,Levetiracetam for Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Network Hyperexcitability,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02002819,LEV-AD,COMPLETED,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can have seizures in addition to losing their memory and other mental functions (referred to as cognitive functions). The seizures, and other examples of overactive electrical activity in the brain that is not noticeable, contribute to the loss of cognitive function. Studies in animal models of AD suggest that a drug that prevents seizures called levetiracetam may reduce neuronal over-excitation and improve cognition. Based on this evidence, the investigators propose to determine if levetiracetam can be used to treat patients with AD. The investigators developed novel instruments for this population that will also be used in future large-scale clinical trials.

The current study will last for 12 weeks and will involve people with AD. Participants will be initially examined with an overnight brain wave study to assess for silent epileptic (seizure-like) activity. Presence of epileptic activity on the screening exam is not required to enter the trial. Participants will then be assigned to groups in a randomized manner. One group will receive levetiracetam for 4 weeks, then no drug for 4 weeks, and then placebo for 4 weeks. For another group, the order of treatments will be reversed. The cognitive abilities of participants will be retested every 4 weeks and compared to those at the beginning. The cognitive tests include a virtual-reality navigation test of memory and computerized tests of mental flexibility and problem solving. The participants will be monitored with a magnetoencephalogram (MEG) with simultaneous EEG (M/EEG) at each visit. M/EEG is a highly effective non-invasive method for identifying brain regions of epileptic activity. The investigators will need to recruit 36 randomized participants to test the study hypotheses. This study will take place at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of Minnesota.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: levetiracetam,"Changes in Executive Function as Measured by the NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery, Changes in executive function were measured using the NIH EXAMINER, a 1-hour computer-based battery of various executive function tasks. The subject's performance after the study treatment will be compared with results from a baseline assessment done before the study treatment, using statistical tests to assess whether there was any significant change. The Examiner assessment consists of the following scales: antisaccade , set shifting , flanker task, dot counting, spatial 1-back, category fluency, and letter fluency. Scores for this task have an indefinite range. Higher scores however do indicate better performance. Scores for this scale were generated using item response theory. For this study, scores with SEs greater than 0.55 were classified as unreliable and excluded from analysis.

MEG-I uses MEG sensor data with millisecond precision and applies source reconstruction algorithms to overlay cortical oscillatory activity onto structural brain images. Source-space MEG-I reconstructions and functional connectivity metrics will be computed with the NUTMEG software suite (http://nutmeg.berkeley.edu). The investigators will compute imaginary coherence, which is a reliable metric for functional connectivity with MEG reconstruction. Functional connectivity will measure the strength of coherence between a given region and the rest of the brain.

It was assessed by a mental health professional (e.g., M.D., Ph.D., Pharm.D., R.N., or other equivalent qualifications) with a minimum of 2 years research experience meeting certification requirements., Change at 24 weeks","Change From Baseline in Global Functioning, Assessed by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Clinical Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC) scale provides a single global rating of change from baseline. It was recommended that the baseline interview be conducted by two raters, one designated as the primary rater, the other as a backup. Both raters were independent trained clinicians, experienced in the assessment of patients with dementia. Neither rater was involved in any other way with the patients' treatment or evaluation throughout the study. At baseline, both raters had access to all of the patient's available records and evaluations. Subsequently, for all ratings of change from baseline, the rater relied solely on information obtained during the baseline interview of the patient and caregiver, including written notes and, if available, the baseline interview audio- or videotape. The rater had no access to any other safety or efficacy data, including all previous post-baseline ADCS-CGIC ratings by either rater., Change at 24 weeks|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) Total Score, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) is a caregiver-based Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scale composed of 23 items developed for use in dementia clinical studies. It was designed to assess the patient's performance of both basic and instrumental activities of daily living such as those necessary for personal care, communicating and interacting with other people, maintaining a household, conducting hobbies and interests, as well as making judgments and decisions. Responses for each item were obtained from the caregiver through an interview. For each basic ADL, there was a forced choice of best response or a ""yes"" or ""no"" question with additional sub questions. Higher numbered scores and answers of ""yes"" reflected a more self-sufficient individual. Therefore, the higher total score, the higher functioning the patient was. The total score was the sum of all items and sub questions. The range for the total ADCS-ADL score was 0 to 78., Change at 24 weeks|Change From Baseline in Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) Total Score, NPI including Caregiver Distress Scale (NPI-D) assesses a wide range of behavior problems encountered in dementia patients to provide a means of distinguishing frequency and severity of changes in behavioral problems \& facilitates rapid behavioral assessment using screening questions.10 behavioral problems \& 2 neurovegetative domains were evaluated through an interview of the caregiver by a mental health professional. The scale includes both frequency \& severity ratings of ea. domain as well as a composite domain score(frequency x severity). Frequency: 1(occasionally) - 4(very frequently)\&severity:1(mild) - 3(marked).The sum of the composite scores of the 12 domains yields the NPI total score.

NCT00594568,Effect of LY450139 on the Long Term Progression of Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00594568,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a fatal degenerative disease of the brain for which there is no cure. AD causes brain cells to die. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta-amyloid (β-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. At autopsy, AD patients are required to have these amyloid plaques in the brain in order to have a definitive diagnosis of AD. Inhibiting the enzyme gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) lowers the production of β-amyloid. Semagacestat (LY450139) is a functional γ-secretase inhibitor and was shown to lower β-amyloid in blood and spinal fluid in humans tested thus far and in blood, spinal fluid, and brain in animals tested thus far. This study used several different tests to measure the effect of semagacestat on both β-amyloid and amyloid plaques for some participants. The build-up of amyloid plaques was measured by a brain scan that takes a picture of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other tests measured the overall function of the brain and brain size in some participants. In this trial, participants who initially received placebo (inactive sugar pill) were, at a certain point in the study, switched over to active drug, semagacestat. In other words, all participants could eventually receive active drug. Participation could last approximately 2 years. Participants taking approved AD medications were permitted to participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study. All participants who completed this study had the option to continue receiving semagacestat by participating in an open-label study.

Preliminary results from this study (H6L-MC-LFAN \[LFAN\]) and another similar study (H6L-MC-LFBC \[LFBC; NCT00762411\]) showed semagacestat did not slow disease progression and was associated with worsening of clinical measures of cognition and the ability to perform activities of daily living. Study drug was stopped in all studies. Studies LFAN, LFBC, and open-label H6L-MC-LFBF (LFBF; NCT01035138) were amended to continue collecting safety data, including cognitive scores, for at least 7 months.

NCT00348309,Rosiglitazone (Extended Release Tablets) As Adjunctive Therapy For Subjects With Mild To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00348309,REFLECT-2,COMPLETED,"Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested in clinical studies and is approved by the FDA as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body is unable to effectively use glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug used in this study, is an extended-release form of RSG.

This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides clinical benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) when combined with the currently approved AD medication, Aricept (donepezil). RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests a new way to treat AD by testing whether one's genetic makeup affects their response to the study drug. Clinical data suggesting that RSG may benefit AD patients was first seen in a small study performed at the University of Washington and then from a larger GSK study conducted in Europe and New Zealand. In the first study, subjects receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored significantly better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that appeared to benefit most from treatment with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They did not have the gene that caused them to produce the protein apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene, instead of APOE e4, from one of their parents. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained at their same level of thinking ability while those with two copies of the APOE e4 gene, continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. The current study will more directly test the effectiveness or RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: Rosiglitazone Extended Release 2mg|DRUG: Rosiglitazone Extended Release 8mg|OTHER: Placebo|OTHER: Donepezil,"Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) Total Score at Week 48, ADAS is a performance-based test that measures specific cognitive and behavioral dysfunctions in participants with Alzheimer's Disease.

Pre-defined limits of potential clinical concern (CC Low \[relative to the lower limit of normal\], CC High \[relative to the upper limit of normal\]) are: Hematocrit 0.8, 1.2; hemoglobin 10-11, 16.5-18; Red blood corpuscles(RBC) 0.8, 1.2; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 0.8, 1.2; mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 0.8, 1.2; White blood corpuscles (WBC) 3- absolute value, 15-absolute value, Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) 0.8, 1.2; Lymphocytes 0.75, 1.5; Monocytes NA, 2; Eosinophil NA, 2; platelet count 100-absolute, 500-absoulte; segmented neutrophil (SN) 0.75, 1.5 and Total Neutrophil (TN) 0.75, 1.5., Baseline (Week 0), Week 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 36, 48 and 56|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Carer Quality of Life Instrument (ACQLI) Total Score, The ACQLI was an assessment of caregiver quality of life. This instrument consists of 30 questions exploring various aspects of carer's quality of life. Each of the questions had a two point response and the 30 questions were summed to provide a total score. Items are assumed to be unidimensional (i.e., represent a single variable) and are scored 0/1 (false/true) before summation into a total score with a 0-30 range. The total score ranged from 0 to 30, where 0 indicated absence of symptoms and higher score indicated worse outcomes; a negative change from baseline indicated improvement. Change from baseline was calculated as endpoint value minus the baseline value., Baseline (Week 0), Week 12, 36 and 48",,GlaxoSmithKline,,ALL,"ADULT,

Participants who received placebo in Study ABE4869g (NCT01343966) or ABE4955g (NCT01397578) will receive crenezumab. Anticipated time on study treatment is 144 weeks.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: Crenezumab,"Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the treatment. . An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events., Up to 50 months|Percentage of Participants by Nature of AEs, A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE that meets any of the following criteria: fatal, life threatening, requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant. Non-SAE of special interest for this study include the following: cerebral vascular edema, Superficial siderosis of central nervous system, cerebral micro-hemorrhages or macro-hemorrhages, pneumonia, liver injury., Up to 50 months|Percentage of Participants by Severity of AEs, AE severity grading scale for the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.0 was used for assessing adverse event severity. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on the following general guideline: Grade 1) mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated, Grade 2) moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL), Grade 3) severe or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self care ADL, Grade 4) life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated, Grade 5) death related to AE., Up to 50 months|Percentage of Participants With Human Anti-Therapeutic Antibody (ATA) Formation, ATA is a measurement to explore the potential relationship of immunogenicity response with pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. Percentage of participants at post-baseline with positive results for ATA against crenezumab are reported., Pre-dose (Day-14), predose at Week 25, 49, 97, Follow-up Week 8 (Week 153) and 12 (Week 157)|Percentage of Participants With Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities Edema/Effusions (ARIA-E), Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with ARIA. The occurrence of imaging abnormalities believed to represent cerebral vasogenic edema, has been reported in association with the investigational use of compounds that are intended to treat Alzheimer's disease by reducing Abeta in the brain. Here, the percentage of participants with symptomatic and asymptomatic ARIA-E were reported., Baseline, Weeks 23, 47, 71, 97, 121 and 153|Percentage of Participants With Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities-Hemorrhage (ARIA-H), AD is associated with ARIA. Cerebral micro-hemorrhages (microbleeds \[MBs\]) are radiologically defined as small dot-like foci of signal loss observed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences sensitive for paramagnetic tissue properties.

NCT00933608,Effects of Memantine on Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy in Subjects at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00933608,,COMPLETED,"Recent data show that marked cell damage precedes the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, targeting populations at risk with pharmacological interventions is a possible strategy to lessen the burden of the disease. Cognitively normal individuals with subjective memory complaints (SMC) manifest biological characteristics consistent with early AD and are at risk for future cognitive decline. Family history of AD also constitutes a risk. In a previous study the investigators showed that memantine slows down the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in normal SMC subjects. Using a multivoxel high field MR spectroscopy (MRS) technique, the investigators also demonstrated that memantine decreased hippocampal glutamate. Both these findings may be consistent with the drug's anti-excitotoxic activity. In this new project the investigators propose to treat a sample of 12 presymptomatic individuals at risk (SMC and family history of AD) with memantine. This will be a double blind, placebo controlled study with a control group (12 non-treated subjects). The investigators will determine whether the effects of memantine as assessed by cognitive performance and MRS are present after 4 months of treatment and persist 2 months after discontinuation. MRS will be used to evaluate the effect of memantine on levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate and neuronal viability marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the hippocampus. The investigators will test the following hypotheses:

1. In subjects with SMC, memantine has modifying effects on brain biochemistry as reflected in MRS reductions in glutamate (reduced excitotoxicity) and increases in NAA (neuronal integrity).
2. The effects of the drug persist (as a marker of sustained neuroprotection) and can be measured 2 months after discontinuation of the treatment.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: memantine|DRUG: Placebo,"N-acetylaspartate, The change in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the primary outcome measure. NAA is a metabolite found predominately in neuronal cells, and its amount indicates tissue well being (the higher the better). In MRS studies NAA (and other metabolites like choline or myoinositol) are presented as a ratio to creatine (Cr) also measured by MRS. The concentration of creatine does not change is used as an internal standard. The ratio NAA/Cr is unitless.

NCT00428090,Rosiglitazone (Extended Release Tablets) As Monotherapy In Subjects With Mild To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00428090,,COMPLETED,"Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested and is approved as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body ineffectively uses glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug, is an extended-release form of RSG. This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests whether one's genes alter the effectiveness of RSG XR. Glucose is used by cells to make energy that they need to live. Changes in the ability of cells to use of glucose can lead to diseases like diabetes. Glucose levels may be lower in the brains of AD patients, and their brain cells may also use glucose less well than in unaffected people. The proper function of brain cells may be critical to memory and thought. If brain cells use glucose poorly, this might impact AD. Drugs that help brain cells properly use glucose may help a person maintain normal memory and thinking. Data suggesting that RSG may help AD patients was first seen in a small study at the Univ. of Washington and then from a larger international GSK study. In the first study, those receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that benefited most from therapy with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They lacked the gene that caused them to produce apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene from one parent. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained fairly stable while those with two copies of APOE e4 continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment. This study will directly test the effect of RSG XR on people who either have or lack the APOE e4 gene.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: Rosiglitazone,"Change From Baseline (W0) in Mean ADAS-Cog Total Score at W24 as a Function of APOE e4 Status in Apolipoprotein epsilon4 (APOE e4) Negative Cohort, The 11-item ADAS-Cog assessed a range of cognitive abilities including memory, comprehension, orientation in time and place and spontaneous speech.

NCT00348140,Rosiglitazone (Extended Release Tablets) As Adjunctive Therapy In Subjects With Mild To Moderate Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00348140,REFLECT-3,COMPLETED,"Rosiglitazone (RSG) has been tested in clinical studies and is approved by the FDA as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, a disease that occurs when the body is unable to effectively use glucose. RSG XR, the investigational drug used in this study, is an extended-release form of RSG.

This study tests whether RSG XR safely provides clinical benefit to people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) when combined with one of the currently approved AD medications, Aricept®, Razadyne® or Exelon®. RSG XR is a new approach to AD therapy and this study tests a new way to treat AD by testing whether one's genetic makeup affects the response to the study drug. Clinical data suggesting that RSG may benefit AD patients was first seen in a small study performed at the University of Washington and then from a larger GSK study conducted in Europe and New Zealand. In the first study, subjects receiving RSG once daily for 6 months scored significantly better on 3 tests of memory and thought than those who did not receive RSG. In the GSK study, those that appeared to benefit most from treatment with RSG XR had a specific genetic pattern. They did not have the gene that caused them to produce the protein apolipoprotein E e4 (APOE e4). Subjects who have the APOE e4 gene may have two copies, one from each parent, or they may have only one APOE e4 gene meaning that they inherited either the APOE e2 or APOE e3 version of the gene, instead of APOE e4, from one of their parents. Subjects with one copy of the APOE e4 gene remained at their same level of thinking ability while those with two copies of the APOE e4 gene, continued to worsen during the 6-month treatment.

Participants were to remember a list of 16 items presented on cards. Participant's task was to learn \& attempt a free recall of the items, followed by a semantically cued recall of items not spontaneously produced during free recall. There were a total of three learning trials, each preceded by 20 seconds of interfering cognitive task. For first two trials, participants were reminded of any item not recalled in cued recall. Free recall (score range: 0-48) \& cued recall (score range: 0-64) assessment occurred immediately, after each of three learning trials, \& after a delay of approx. 30 minutes.

Preclinical AD was defined as participants who were at certain risk of developing AD dementia but did not have overt symptoms and did not meet criteria for MCI or dementia., Baseline up to approximately Week 416|Period A: Time to Progression to Non-zero in CDR Scale Global Score, Time to progression was defined as the time at baseline to first increase in the CDR global score i.e., score of \> zero on the CDR Global scale. The standard CDR global scale describes five degrees of impairment in performance on each of six categories of cognitive functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. The ratings of degree of impairment obtained on each of the six categories of function was synthesized into one global rating of dementia with a score ranging from 0 to 3 (0 = no dementia, 0.5 = questionable dementia, 1 = mild dementia, 2 = moderate dementia, 3 = severe dementia). A higher score indicates a greater degree of impairment., Baseline up to approximately Week 416|Period A: Annualized Rate of Change in the CDR Scale - Sum of Boxes (SOB), The CDR-SB is a rater administered scale and impairment is scored in the following categories: memory, orientation, judgment and problem solving, community affairs, home and hobbies and personal care. Impairment was scored on a scale in which no dementia = 0, questionable dementia = 0.5, mild dementia = 1, moderate dementia = 2 and severe dementia = 3. The 6 individual category ratings, or ""box scores"", were added together to give the CDR-Sum of Boxes which ranges from 0-18, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Annualized rate of change in CDR Scale - SOB was calculated using RCRM., Baseline up to approximately Week 416|Period A: Annualized Rate of Change in a Measure of Overall Neurocognitive Functioning: RBANS, RBANS is a clinical tool designed to detect and characterize the earliest neurocognitive changes associated with dementia. The RBANS comprised of 12 subtests which generates age-adjusted index scores for five neurocognitive domains: Immediate Memory, Visuospatial/Constructional, Language, Attention and Delayed Memory, which are used to calculate a Total Scale Index score. RBANS Total Score = Index Score based on the (Index Score for Immediate Memory + Index Score for Visuospatial/Constructional + Index Score for Language + Index Score for Attention + Index Score for Delayed Memory). Index scores and total scores range from 40-160. A higher score indicates better cognitive functioning. Annualized rate of change in RBANS was calculated using RCRM., Baseline up to approximately Week 416|Period A: Annualized Rate of Change in Mean Cerebral Fibrillar Amyloid Accumulation Using Florbetapir Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Amyloid deposition in brain is one of the defining neuropathologic findings of AD. Cerebral amyloid burden \& effect of crenezumab on cerebral amyloid were assessed using 18F- Florbetapir PET. Florbetapir exhibits high affinity specific binding to amyloid plaques, which allows for a measurement of the relative amyloid burden as the ratio of the standard uptake values (SUVR) in a cortical composite region of interest (including the frontal, temporal, parietal, and cingulate cortices with a subcortical white matter reference region). Annualized rate of change in cerebral fibrillar amyloid accumulation was calculated using RCRM., Baseline up to approximately Week 416|Period A: Annualized Rate of Change in Regional Cerebral Metabolic Rate of Glucose (CMRgI) Using Fluorine-18-Labeled 2-Deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in a Predefined ROI, Regional CMRgl and the effect of crenezumab on regional CMRgl was assessed using FDG-PET. FDG PET evaluates the regional brain metabolic rates for glucose as a sensitive, in vivo metabolic index of brain function. Regional CMRgl was derived from FDG PET images using an empirically predefined statistical ROI (sROI) known to be preferentially affected by CMRgl decline in participants with AD. Results are reported as standardized uptake value ratios. Annualized rate of change in CMRgI was calculated using RCRM., Baseline up to approximately Week 416|Period A: Annualized Rate of Change in Brain Atrophy Measured by Volumetric Measurements Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The change in brain atrophy after treatment with crenezumab was measured by volumetric measurements using MRI which measures volumes of the key brain structures-hippocampus, ventricles, and other brain structures-and compares the volumes to standard norms based on the age, gender and cranial volume. The regions of interest for atrophy measurement included whole brain, bilateral hippocampus, and bilateral ventricles. The annualized rate of change in brain atrophy was calculated using RCRM., Baseline up to approximately Week 416|Period A: Annualized Rate of Change in Tau-Based Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) Biomarkers (Total Tau (tTau) and Phospho-tau (pTau), CSF biomarker tTau has been considered as a general marker of neurodegeneration. CSF phospho-tau is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration.

AD is characterized by severe impairments in learning, memory and other cognitive abilities that significantly interfere with daily functioning. The neuropathologic hallmarks of AD consist of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and selective neuronal cell loss. Amyloid plaques, which contain Abeta protein, are believed to play an integral role in the development of AD. Elevated levels of Abeta in the brain are also correlated with cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's (AD) develops insidiously, making it difficult to identify early, yet treatment is most effective when begun during the early stages of the disease. Thus, it has become important for researchers to identify markers of early AD. This project will examine the relationship between four potential markers that may indicate the early development of AD:

1. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI)or normal cognition
2. Practice effects
3. Amyloid plaque binding on 18F-PIB PET
4. Glucose hypometabolism on FDG PET

This project will recruit 25 subjects from an ongoing community-based study of memory and practice effects in cognitively normal, community-dwelling individuals who are age 65 and over (NIA #5K23AG028417-05). Each subject will undergo positron emission tomography (PET) with both 18F-Flutemetamol and FDG.

In rTMS, magnetic pulses are used to noninvasively stimulate focal areas of cortex of about a square centimeter in area. rTMS has been approved in the United States for the diagnosis of peripheral nerve conditions.

Depending on the frequency of stimulation, rTMS can preferentially stimulate or inhibit cortical areas. In stroke rehabilitation, for example, inhibition of the contralateral, uninvolved hemisphere by low frequency rTMS has improved movement of the affected limbs because of less aberrant inhibition of the affected hemisphere by the healthy hemisphere. The effects of rTMS has also been investigated and found to be useful in treating refractory depression and depression in Parkinson's disease. In addition, rTMS has improved naming in patients with Alzheimer's disease and has improved cognitive abilities and memory in non-demented older adults. Two studies found that rTMS improved aphasia in patients with stroke. While these studies are small, a review of the literature suggests that there may be a beneficial role for rTMS in patients with chronic neurological conditions. In addition, rTMS appears to be well tolerated, with transient headaches being the most common side effect.

In this small open label study, the investigators wish to investigate the usefulness of bilateral stimulation of the brain region termed the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in patients with AD who have naming and language deficits.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease|Aphasia|Dementia,DEVICE: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Coil Stimulation (rTMS),"Cognitive Assessment Task Scores Before, During and After rTMS., Cognitive assessment tasks - Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE), CFL Category naming (CFL), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) - were administered and scored according to standard procedures before, during and 4 weeks after rTMS.

NCT05147428,A Program to Reduce Inappropriate Medications Among Older Adults With Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05147428,D-PRESCRIBE-AD,COMPLETED,"Potentially inappropriate prescribing includes the use of medications that may no longer be necessary or that may increase the risk of harm. Inappropriate prescribing can increase the overall symptom burden, and negatively affect health-related quality of life and function. The inappropriate prescription of certain drug categories such as sedative/hypnotics, antipsychotics, and strong anticholinergic agents poses particular risks for older adults, and may be more common among those with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease- related dementias (AD/ADRD) due to a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and more frequent prescription of five or more medications. The D-PRESCRIBE-AD (Developing a PRogram to Educate and Sensitize Caregivers to Reduce the Inappropriate Prescription Burden in Elderly with Alzheimer's Disease) study will test a health plan-based intervention using the NIH Collaboratory's Distributed Research Network, which employs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel System infrastructure. The overarching goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a patient/caregiver- centered, multifaceted educational intervention on potentially inappropriate prescribing in patients with AD/ADRD. The research hypothesis is that education on inappropriate prescribing among patients/caregivers and their providers can reduce medication-related morbidity in patients with AD/ADRD and improve medication safety for this vulnerable population. The study population will include community-dwelling patients with AD/ADRD, identified based on diagnoses codes of AD/ADRD or use of a medication for Alzheimer's Disease, who have evidence of potentially inappropriate prescribing the three drug classes above. The trial will evaluate the effect of educational interventions designed to spur patient/caregiver-provider communication about medication safety (versus usual care) on the proportion of patients with inappropriate prescribing, the primary outcome of this study.

NCT03405662,Impact of Photobiomodulation (PBM) on Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03405662,PBMbiomarker,COMPLETED,"Photobiomodulation (PBM) describes the use of near-infrared light (which is not visible to the eye) to heal and protect tissue that has either been injured, is degenerating, or else is at risk of dying. Research suggests that the light delivered during PBM enhances the body's biochemical ability to store and use energy and increase blood flow, which triggers the body's natural healing processes. The primary goal of this study is to determine if PBM administered transcranially (through the scalp and skull) and intranasally (inside the nose) with a commercially available device is safe and tolerable for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Secondary goals are to examine whether tPBM has an effect on cognitive function and behavioral symptoms in patients with AD and whether tPBM has an effect on fluid biomarkers of AD. A biomarker is a specific physical trait used to measure the progress of a disease or condition.",YES,Alzheimer Disease,DEVICE: Vielight Neuro Gamma|OTHER: Sham Vielight Neuro Gamma,"Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), The ADAS-cog is the most popular cognitive testing instrument used in clinical trials of nootropics. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis, attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. Higher ADAS-cog scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.

The changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the ADAS-cog score at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores \< 1 or \> 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in ADAS-cog score compared to baseline., Baseline to 16 weeks","Change in Performance on Color Trails Test (CTT2/CTT1 Index), CTT is a non-verbal test of visual attention, graphomotor sequencing, and effortful executive processing abilities (i.e., sustained attention and set shifting). A higher index score indicates less cognitive flexibility, a lower ability to shift attention., Baseline to 16 weeks|Change on the Neuropsychiatriac Inventory (NPI), NPI is a well-validated, reliable, multi-item instrument to assess psychopathology (e.g., behavioral symptoms) in AD based on a questionnaire completed by the participants' study partners. Higher scores indicate more symptoms and/or more severe symptoms.

The changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the week 16 NPI score over the baseline NPI score. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores \< 1 or \> 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in NPI compared to baseline., Baseline to 16 weeks|Change on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), ADCS-ADL assesses the competence of patients with AD in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs). It can be completed by a caregiver in questionnaire format, or administered by a clinician/researcher as a structured interview with a caregiver. ADCS-ADL scores range from 0-53, with higher scores indicating greater independence. The changes score was determined by calculating the ratio of the week 16 ADCS-ADL score over the baseline ADCS-ADL score. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores \< 1 or \> 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in ADCS-ADL compared to baseline., Baseline to 16 weeks|Change in Plasma Levels of Aβ42, Although Aβ42 is present in plasma, it is unclear whether it originates from peripheral sources or from the brain. Because Aβ can be transported bidirectionally across the blood-brain barrier, it has been hypothesized that there may be an equilibrium between CSF and plasma pools of Aβ. Decreased levels of Aβ42 in CSF occurs in conjunction with cognitive decline. However, patients with mutations in chromosome 21 that cause early-onset familial AD and patients with trisomy 21 have increased levels of plasma Aβ42 before the onset of the symptoms of dementia. Therefore, it is possible that plasma Aβ42 levels increase with cognitive decline. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of plasma Aβ42 at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline., Baseline to 16 weeks|Change in CSF Levels of Aβ42., Aβ42 is a biomarker of AD pathology. CSF levels of Aβ42 decrease in conjunction with the cognitive decline. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of CSF Aβ42 at week 16 over the ADAS-cog score at baseline. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores \< 1 or \> 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in CSF levels of Aβ42 compared to baseline., Baseline to 16 weeks|Change in Plasma Levels of Tau., Tau, the microtubule-associated protein, forms insoluble filaments that accumulate as neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research suggests that plasma tau levels increased with AD severity. The change score was determined by calculating the ratio of the week 16 plasma tau over the baseline plasma tau levels. Thus, a change score of 1 signifies no change compared to baseline and change scores \< 1 or \> 1 reflect a decrease or an increase in plasma tau compared to baseline., Baseline to 16 weeks|Change in CSF Levels of Tau, Tau forms insoluble filaments that accumulate as neurofibrillary tangles in AD.

Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical areas of the brain relative to the cerebellum as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects the larger cortical amyloid burden relative to cerebellum. SUVR values were further calibrated to a centiloid (CL) scale. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan.

Quantitative tau burden was formalized using two measures: weighted average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (MUBADA SUVR) in the brain relative to the cerebellum gray as a reference region and the global tau load (TauL) generated using a TauIQ method. Larger weighted average SUVR reflects the larger cortical tau burden relative to cerebellum gray.

NCT03290326,tACS for Amyloid-β Reduction in Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03290326,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque buildup and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the brain, as well as widespread neurodegeneration. The evidence suggests that both amyloid and tau play a critical role in AD and interventions that reliably and safely decrease the intracerebral burden of amyloid or tau could potentially be of marked clinical importance. Currently, therapeutic options are very limited and while there are pharmacologic interventions that transiently improve cognitive function, there are no treatments that alter disease progression. The current study seeks to use a novel therapeutic intervention that uses noninvasive brain stimulation to target amyloid in the brain. The investigators anticipate this will decrease the amyloid levels in the brain, as evidence by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging.",YES,Alzheimer Disease,DEVICE: Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS),"Change in Amyloid Burden, Changes in the amyloid load observed via PET imaging will be evaluated by comparing PET data acquired before and after the 10 tACS sessions. The metric used is SUVR, a measure of the amount of proteins in the brain identified at the PET exam. We will calculate the difference between pre and post tACS SUVR (dSUVR) for the entire brain and report the average value (and standard deviation) for the entire group of patients. A negative value express a decrease in the amount of proteins in the brain post tACS intervention. It must be considered that dSUVR values refer to the entire brain, however patients were treated according to personalized tACS montages targeting patient-specific regions mostly affected by the pathology. This might have led to slightly different changes in SUVR in different part of the brain across participants. Also, as per standard procedures, results are presented at group level, i.e. without considering individual differences in longitudinal amyloid load changes., Up to six weeks","Change in EEG Gamma-band Spectral Power, EEG power spectral densities (PSD) before and after the tACS intervention were evaluated, specifically absolute and relative power density values (μV2/Hz) were calculated within the gamma band (35-45Hz).

Change from baseline is calculated as the observed value minus the baseline value., Day 169|Change From Baseline ADAS-Cog11 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition Subscale), The ADAS-Cog11 total score = the sum of all 11 individual items (word recall \[10\]; commands \[5\]; constructional praxis \[5\]; naming objects and fingers \[5\]; ideational praxis \[5\]; orientation \[8\]; word recognition \[12\]; remembering test instructions \[5\]; spoken language \[5\]; word finding \[5\]; and comprehension of spoken language \[5\]). The score range for ADAS-cog 11 is 0-70 where a higher score is worse performance. The ADAS-cog methodology is to sum scores for subscales. The results were calculated using the average change from baseline. Baseline is defined as the last measurement taken before the first dose of study drug is administered. Change is calculated as the observed value minus the baseline value. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement., Day 169|Change From Baseline ADAS-Cog13 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition Subscale), The ADAS-Cog13 total score includes all of the items in the ADAS-Cog11 and the delayed word recall and the number cancellation. For the ADAS-cog 13 the range is 0-85 (score range for Delayed Word Recall \[DWR\] score is 0-10 and for Number Cancellation \[NC\] is 0-5, thus the score is ADAS-cog 11\[0-70\] plus the scores for DWR and NC). A higher score indicates worse performance. The ADAS-cog methodology is to sum scores for subscales. The results were calculated using the average change from baseline. Baseline is defined as the last measurement taken before the first dose of study drug. Change is calculated as the observed value minus the baseline value. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement in cognitive function., Day 169|Change From Baseline ADAS-Cog14 (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognition Subscale), The ADAS-Cog14 total score includes all of the items in the ADAS-Cog13 \[0-85\] and the maze item which has a score range of 0-5. Thus, the total score for the ADAS-cog 14 is 0-90 where again a higher score is worst performance. The ADAS-cog methodology is to sum scores for subscales. The results were calculated using the average change from baseline. Baseline is defined as the last measurement taken before the first dose of study drug is administered. Change is calculated as the observed value minus the baseline value. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement in cognitive function., Day 169|Change From Baseline in ADCS-Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item informant-administered assessment of functional impairment in terms of activities of daily living. Informants respond to 23 questions about the subject's involvement and level of performance across items representing daily living. The questions range from basic to instrumental activities of daily living. Each item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss. The total score range is from 0-78 with lower scores indicating greater functional impairment. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement in function.

The results were calculated using the average change from baseline. Higher scores mean better outcome.

Negative mean indicates worsening of function. Positive mean indicates improvement of function., Day 169|Change From Baseline in Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), The MMSE assesses several aspects of memory and cognitive functioning including orientation, attention, concentration, comprehension, recall, and praxis. The total possible score is 30, with high scores indicating less impairment. Change from baseline is calculated as the observed value minus the baseline value. A positive change from baseline indicates improvement in cognition., Day 169|Change From Baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Scores were on a scale of 0 through 3, with 0=no dementia, 0.5=questionable dementia, 1=mild dementia, 2=moderate dementia, and 3=severe dementia. Cognitive and functional abilities that were assessed include Memory; Orientation; Judgment and Problem Solving; Community Affairs; Home and Hobbies; and Personal Care. Memory was considered as the primary driver for scoring and the other categories were secondary. The change from baseline in the CDR-SB total score was analyzed using the mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM). Change from baseline is calculated as the observed value minus the baseline value. Higher scores mean worsening of disease., Day 169|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Clinical Study - Clinician Global Impression of Change (ADCS-CGIC), The scale consists of a format with which a clinician may address clinically relevant overall change, including 15 areas under the domains of cognition, behavior, and social and daily functioning. For ADCS-CGIC, the individual data listing presented the original score on the seven-point scale. In addition, the seven-point score was collapsed to 3 groups, combining scores 1-3 to ""Improved"", 4 to ""No change"", and 5-7 to ""Worsening"". Lower scores indicate improvement., Day 169|Change From Baseline in the Cognitive Composite, The Cognitive composite included:

1. 6 ADAS-Cog items: word recall, orientation, delayed word recall, word recognition, number cancellation, and maze
2. 4 Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) items: Trail Making Test (TMT) A, Trail Making Test (TMT) B, Category Fluency Test (CFT), Digit span.

Each individual z-score was calculated by first computing the baseline mean and standard deviation at baseline for all subjects within each individual component. The z-scores were then derived for each subject and timepoint by subtracting the corresponding baseline mean from the observed value and then dividing by the standard deviation at baseline. The sign of the z-score for the following components was reversed when deriving the Composite scores: Word recall, Orientation, Delayed Word Recall, Word Recognition, Maze, TMT A, TMT B.

The ADAS-Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline. Data presented are posterior mean with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-iADL) Score, The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures basic, instrumental activities of daily living by participants (instrumental activity items 6a, 7-23). The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59, with lower scores indicating greater disease severity. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline. Data presented are posterior mean with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline. Data presented are posterior mean with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) Score, The MMSE is a brief instrument used to assess cognitive function. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention. The maximum score for the first section is 21. The second section tests the ability of the person to name objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures. The maximum score for the second section is 9. The range for the total MMSE score is 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater level of impairment. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline. Data presented are posterior mean with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline in Brain Aggregated Tau Deposition as Measured by Flortaucipir F-18 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan., Deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain associated with AD was assessed by quantitative PET scan using flortaucipir F-18. Flortaucipir is an F-18-labeled small molecule that binds with high affinity and selectivity to aggregated tau, and provides a measure of aggregated tau deposition in the brain, expressed as flortaucipir standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr). Change from baseline was calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and continuous effect of baseline SUVr and age. A positive change from baseline indicates increased aggregated tau deposition that is believed to be associated with a more rapid rate of cognitive deterioration., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline in Brain Volume as Measured by Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (vMRI), Alzheimer's disease is also associated with pronounced brain atrophy, reflecting bulk neurodegenerative loss of gray and white matter. Progression of brain atrophy is assessed by vMRI, providing regional quantification of volume loss. Negative change from baseline indicates greater disease severity. Change from baseline was calculated using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and continuous effect of baseline vMRI, baseline intracranial volume (ICV) and age., Baseline, Week 104|Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation and Behaviors Assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), C-SSRS is a scale capturing occurrence, severity, and frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviours, and has a binary response (yes/no).

By measuring an area within the posterior cingulate gyrus, one can obtain a biochemical signature of that region in AD whereby NAA is reduced and mI is increased.

These two biomarkers, N-acetylaspartate (NAA, a neuronal marker) and myo-inositol (mI, a glial marker) were quantified and then used to calculate NAA/mI (an index currently widely used for AD and MCI diagnosis).

Scale of MRS biomarkers for aged-matched controls: NAA = 1.43, mI = 0.60, NAA/mI = 2.38. Any value lower than NAA/mI of 2.38 are considered not normal.

NCT03073876,Detecting an Early Response to Donepezil With Measures of Visual Attention,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03073876,,COMPLETED,"Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChE-I) comprise a class of drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD), but controversy about their usefulness remains. Modest response rates of treated versus placebo groups, small effect sizes with respect to efficacy, drug costs, and clinical relevance of the effects are problematic. Standard efficacy measures of efficacy are not sufficiently sensitive, and trying to assess cognitive change after 4-6 months of therapy confounds the drug effect and the natural progression of the disease.

Surprisingly, attention has never been included in the assessment of AChE-I drugs. The rationale for using attentional measures are that (1) Attentional deficits are recognized as a critical cognitive change in the earliest phases of AD; (2) Attentional function is directly mediated by the cholinergic system, and responds rapidly to cholinergic augmentation, particularly on tasks that tax available attentional capacity are dose dependent; and (3) Acetylcholine is depleted in AD. However, the link between attention and cholinergic depletion in AD has not been fully explored, especially with regard to response to cholinergic treatment.

The study tests if attentional performance can be a more sensitive marker of response. In a longitudinal study we measure attentional, as well as cognitive and behavioral performance in de novo AD patients undergoing donepezil treatment. The investigators develop visual attentional measures and contrast them to global and domain-specific cognitive scores on three occasions (T1) baseline pre-treatment, (T2) after approximately 6 weeks, and (T3) after 6 months treatment. The T1-to-T2 arm is a double-blind placebo control period, after which members of the placebo group start open-label treatment. The assessment at 6 months allows us to determine whether the changes seen earlier at T2 can predict patients who respond, or determine which measures best predict response.

We hypothesize that attention measures are more sensitive than standard global measures or other cognitive domains and that the change of attentional function can be detected after only after approximately 6 weeks treatment.

Many older adults who live in senior communities, such as independent living and assisted living residences, find wayfinding very challenging. Often times, these communities are not designed in a way that helps people find their way very easily. When people cannot find their way, they can get lost, be dependent upon others for getting out and about, or even be afraid to leave their rooms. The purpose of this study is to find out if distinctive signs and decorative elements, along with a special type of education called Spaced-Retrieval education, help residents in these communities find their way more effectively. Twelve senior communities will be assigned by chance to one of three conditions, including: 1) control - no change (the community stays the same); 2) signs and decorative elements enhanced; and 3) signs, decorative elements, and special education added. After agreeing to be in the study, the participants will be asked to find their way to certain places in their community four times over a year. Some people will be asked to participate in educational sessions on wayfinding. In addition, some people will be asked to wear a location tracker, (like a fitness tracker), for four weeks during the year. How well people find their way, along with how much they travel about within the communities, will be compared between the three groups. It is hypothesized that those in the communities with special signs and decorative elements will find their way more effectively than those in the control communities. It is also hypothesized that participants in the communities with the special education intervention will find their way better than those without the education. Finally, it is hypothesized that participants in the communities with signs and cues and education will travel about further distances than those in the control communities.

NCT03442322,Optimizing Care for Patients With Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03442322,,COMPLETED,"Of the 1.4 million nursing home (NH) residents in long term care facilities, more than half have Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Due to changes in their familiar daily routines, difficulty expressing their thoughts or asking for what they need, and overstimulation (such as noise) or under stimulation (such as lack of activity), individuals with dementia often display disruptive behaviors like resisting help or continually repeating the same phrases. Medications are often prescribed to reduce agitation and aggressive behavior; however, these medications may not be effective and can have a negative impact on the individual. Therefore, families and other stakeholders strongly advocate the use of other types of approaches that focus on minimizing the cause of the behavior. Two facility-based methodologies include the transdisciplinary approach for integrated dementia care, which combines the expertise of all NH staff, who work together to build a common language and approach for each resident, and the multidisciplinary approach for problem-based dementia care, in which each staff member conducts individual assessments and makes discipline-specific recommendations. While prior research suggests that both of these facility-based approaches are useful, the circumstances under which each approach is most effective are not clear. This project will prospectively randomize 80 nursing homes to one of the two treatment arms to compare the effect of the transdisciplinary approach versus the multidisciplinary approach.

Three-quarters of hospitalized persons with ADRD display Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) associated with functional and cognitive decline, increased resource consumption, institutionalization, premature death, and caregiver burden. The overall objective is to test the preliminary efficacy of an innovative model of care, PES-4-BPSD, for reducing BPSD by empowering Patient Engagement Specialists (PES) to deliver dementia care for acutely-ill patients with ADRD. Traditionally, mental health assistants with training in crisis-prevention techniques provide care to psychiatric patients. On the intervention unit, these mental health assistants, as PES, purposefully engage patients with BPSD. In the pilot study, investigators found patients with cognitive impairment admitted to the PES unit were significantly less likely to require constant observation, chemical and physical restraints, suggesting improved management of BPSD. The central hypothesis is that PES-4-BPSD will improve the ability of PES to create an ""enabling"" milieu that addresses factors leading to BPSD and improves the experience of hospital caregivers. Guided by a social-ecological framework, PES-4-BPSD incorporates dementia education and training, environmental modifications-cohorting, increased staffing-PES, and staff support. The investigators' multidisciplinary research team is well-positioned to accomplish the following: Aim 1) Determine the preliminary efficacy of PES-4-BPSD for reducing BPSD during hospitalization, and Aim 2) Evaluate whether dementia care training improves the perceived ability of PES staff (intervention) and nurse assistant staff (control) to care for hospitalized persons with ADRD. For Aim 1, investigators will conduct a non-randomized preliminary efficacy trial of the PES-4-BPSD intervention enrolling N=158 patients (79 control, 79 intervention). The primary outcome will be presence of BPSD during hospitalization using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). In Aim 2, investigators will use survey methodology in a repeated measures design to evaluate within and between-group differences in attitudes, experience, and satisfaction toward managing patients with ADRD. Measures will be completed at baseline (T1), immediately following training (T2), and at the end of the intervention period (T3). This proposal will be the first to study an innovative model of care utilizing PES as specialized hospital caregivers for reducing BPSD in the hospital setting.

NCT04117178,Monitoring Anti-Dementia Drugs by Serum Levels,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04117178,MONANTI,COMPLETED,"The main objective of the MONANTI study is twofold:

Firstly, to determine the serum concentration (SC) the anti-dementia drugs donepezil and memantine in a broadly defined clinical population of patients suffering from dementia treated with the two drugs in question. Secondly, to determine whether adjustment of treatment of anti-dementia medication based on measurements of the SC will benefit patients in terms of cognitive performance, activities of daily living (ADL), frequency and severity of side effects.

The reason for conduction of this study is that the relationship between serum-level of anti-dementia drugs, clinical efficacy, compliance and side effects has only been scarcely investigated.

Both a previously published study and a preliminary (pilot)study conducted imply that roughly 50 % of patients on donepezil have SC outside the recommended therapeutic reference range (TRR).

Thus, MONANTI will investigate if this is indeed the case in a broadly comprised population of patients with dementia treated with donepezil or memantine. In addition, MONANTI will link SC to co-morbidity, level of compliance, medication interactions. It is hypothesized that the efficacy of anti-dementia drugs can be significantly improved by adjustment of treatment according to SC. Also, it is hypothesized that the burden of side effects can be reduced in patients in whom too high SC are detected, if dose reduction or change of treatment drug is done.

MONANTI is a randomized study, in which the assessor is blinded to avoid related biases to the extent possible.

To meet the enrollment criteria eligible participants must:

A) be newly diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease dementia, dementia with Lewy-bodies or Parkinson's disease with dementia and B) be scheduled for treatment with either donepezil or memantine. C) not meet a list of (exclusion) criteria, which have been set up in order to avoid blur and biases of the results.

D) be able to give written informed consent to participation in presence of a close relative.

After enrollment the participants will be randomly assigned to one of two study groups. In the first of these, the control group, the participants receive standard treatment and follow-up at the outpatient clinic. In addition, all participants in the control group who complete the trial will have a blood sample collected at the final visit to measure the SC of the anti-dementia drug along with a genetic test for a few key genes thought to be relevant for the study (two liver enzymes (cyp2D6, cyp3A4/5, APOE-genotype, butyrylcholine-esterase K-variant).

In the other group, the intervention group, the participators will be closely monitored for side effects after prescription of anti-dementia drugs. All participants in the intervention group will be offered a measurement of the SC in case they experience drug side effects within 2 months of treatment initiation. All participants in the intervention group will have a measurement of the SC done at the 6 months visit. The measured SC will be compared to the TRR of the drug in question. This information, along with details from the clinical assessment at the 6 month visit will be used to guide the decision of whether or not to adjust treatment. All decisions on treatment adjustment during the trial are done by the PI according to details in the protocol.

All participants in the intervention group are evaluated again at a 12 month visit, identical to that of the control groups.

To assess the possible effects of SC guided treatment adjustment six clinical tests/rating scales will be used (MMSE, ACE, NPI-Q, DAD, CGI, GDS). The tests/rating scales will be administered both at the enrollement visit and one year later at the final 12 month follow-up visit.

To measure the effect of donepezil on brain cholinergic function approx. 30 participants will be recruited for electroencephalography (EEG). These participants will have an EEG done at enrollment and after 12 months.

In addition to the above mentioned quantitative study a qualitative study with relatives of enrolled participants is planned.

NCT04080544,Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04080544,,COMPLETED,The investigators will conduct tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans on 125 adults using the radiopharmaceutical Flortaucipir F18 (\[18F\]AV-1451). This will allow the investigators to determine tau deposition across adults of different ages and assess the relationship of current tau burden to cognitive function and amyloid deposition collected over the previous 10-year interval.,YES,Alzheimer Disease|Cognitive Decline,DRUG: [18F]AV-1451|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography,"Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVrs) Calculated From [18F]AV-1451 PET Scans, Tau accumulation in the temporal lobe will be measured as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) computed from each participant's \[18F\]AV-1451 PET scans averaged across six bilateral regions of interest (ROls) by normalizing regional counts to the whole cerebellum. The 6 ROls are: inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Each participant's PET scan and the six bilateral ROIs will be coregistered to their T1-weighted MRI (MP-RAGE). Finally, the mean observed tracer count from each region will be extracted and normalized using whole cerebellum as the reference. Observed tau SUVR scores in humans range from 0.5 to 2.5, with higher scores being indicative of greater tau accumulation. Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent analyses will use this temporal tau SUVR and will involve examination of cross-sectional relationships between tau SUVR and key outcome measures at Wave 3 of the DLBS., An average of 3-months post-PET study visit","Relationship of Tau Burden to Episodic Memory Function, Episodic memory is a construct that measures how well individuals can store, maintain, and retrieve detailed information in long-term memory. Episodic memory will be a composite score using the Hopkins Verbal Learning test with 3 subcomponents (immediate recall: range 0-12, delayed recall: range 0-12, and recognition: range 0-24) and the immediate recall of the CANTAB Verbal Recognition Memory task (range 0-12). Scores from the tasks will be converted to Z-scores and averaged to form an episodic memory composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score. A higher composite Z-score indicates better episodic memory, a Z-score of 0 represents the population mean, and all Z-scores have a standard deviation of 1. Values in this table represent this Episodic Memory Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Amyloid Accumulation to Tau Burden, Amyloid accumulation throughout the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (6-9.8 years) will be measured with Florbetapir F18 and calculated as an Amyloid Standard Uptake Value ratio (SUVR) by normalizing regional counts to the whole cerebellum. Amyloid SUVR scores will be averaged across eight cortical regions spanning most of the cortex: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, and lateral occipital lobe. Amyloid SUVR scores observed in this study have ranged from 0.88 to 1.74, with higher scores being indicative of greater amyloid accumulation. Finally, annualized change scores for these amyloid SUVRs across the full study duration (6-9.8 years) will be calculated to determine the extent that the rate of amyloid accumulation relates to tau burden at the end of the study., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Speed of Processing, Speed of processing is a construct that measures how rapidly individuals can process information. To assess speed of processing, a composite score will be created using the Digit Comparison task and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Digit Symbol task. Observed DLBS raw scores range from 27 to 116 for Digit Comparison task and 20 to 90 for Digit Symbol task. Participants' raw scores are converted to Z-scores and averaged to form a speed of processing composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score.

Values in this table represent this Speed of Processing Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Reasoning, The construct of reasoning measures an individual's ability to recognize novel patterns and the conceptual relationship among objects and effectively apply these patterns to solve similar problems. To assess reasoning, a composite score will be created using the Raven's Progressive Matrices task and Educational Testing Service (ETS) Letters Sets task. Observed DLBS raw scores range from 9 to 30 for Raven's Progressive Matrices task and from 0.5 to 30 for ETS Letters Sets task. Raven's Progress Matrices and ETS Letter Sets will be converted to Z-scores and averaged to form a reasoning composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score. A higher composite Z-score indicates higher reasoning ability, a Z-score of 0 represents the population mean, and all Z-scores have a standard deviation of 1. Values in this table represent this Reasoning Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Working Memory, Working memory is a construct that measures the ability of individuals to simultaneously manipulate and store information. To assess working memory, a composite score will be created using the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task (reverse scored) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) Letter Number Sequencing task. Observed DLBS raw scores range from 0 to 86 total errors for the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task and 2 to 20 for the WAIS-III Letter Number Sequencing task. Participants' raw scores are converted to Z-scores and averaged to form a working memory composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score.

Values in this table represent this Working Memory Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Participants' Age, Linear regressions between the AV-1451 SUVR in each of the temporal regions of interest with participant age will be calculated, and in additional analyses, non-linear effects of age will be examined via quadratic and growth modeling. Observed AV-1451 SUVR scores in humans have ranged from 0.5 to 2.5, with higher scores being indicative of greater tau accumulation. The investigators predict that tau accumulation will accelerate in old age, thus supporting a non-linear rate of deposition., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Cortical Thickness, Regional cortical thickness will be estimated from previously acquired T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scans using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3), with surface parcellation manually edited when necessary by our team of experts. The regions selected for analyses of cortical thickness were the ROIs used to estimate temporal tau SUVR: inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Observed cortical thickness in these regions range from 1.38 to 3.83 mm with higher scores indicating greater thickness., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Hippocampal Volume, Hippocampal volume will be estimated from previously acquired T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scans using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3), with surface parcellation manually edited when necessary by our team of experts. This region was selected for analysis as it was one of the ROIs used to estimate temporal tau SUVR. Observed DLBS hippocampal volume ranged from 1843 to 5342 mm\^3 with higher scores indicating greater volume., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to White Matter Integrity, White matter integrity will be assessed using the estimated volume of white matter hypointensities from previously acquired T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scans using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3). Observed DLBS white matter hypointensities range from 796 to 35,037 mm\^3 with higher scores indicating greater volume of hypointensities and reflecting worse white matter integrity., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), For functional measures, blood oxygenation level dependent signal from contrasts of interest using selected ROls will be created. For the semantic judgment task (easy judgments - fixation), the investigators will focus on ROIs associated with processing meaning, including inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus. Observed BOLD activation values (betas) ranged from -1.00 to 1.30 with higher values indicating greater activation., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Resting-State Brain System Segregation, Resting-state brain system segregation was computed on data collected from a separate resting-state scan using graph theory. System segregation is calculated as (Zw - Zb) / Zw, where Zw is the mean Fisher z-transformed r between nodes with the same system and Zb is the mean Fisher z-transformed r between nodes of one system to all nodes in other systems. Higher values indicate reduced node-node connectivity between systems relative to within-system connectivity. A score of 0 would reflect equal resting-state connectivity between nodes within the same functional system and between nodes of separate systems. Like all Z-scores, these scores typically range from -3 to 3. Higher scores are observed in younger adults than in older adults and may suggest a more youth-like brain, though higher scores are not objectively better.

The rationale for these studies is derived from growing evidence that insulin contributes to multiple brain functions, and that insulin dysregulation can contribute to AD pathogenesis. Thus, therapies aimed at restoring normal insulin signaling in the CNS may have beneficial effects on brain function. Intranasal administration of insulin increases insulin signaling in the brain without raising peripheral levels and causing hypoglycemia. Insulin detemir is an insulin analogue that may have better action in brain than other insulin formulations because of its albumin binding properties. The investigators will test the therapeutic effects of intranasally-administered insulin detemir in a study in which participants will receive insulin detemir, regular insulin, or placebo over a four month period.

NCT01958437,Enhancing Spatial Navigation Using Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01958437,,COMPLETED,"Remembering how to travel from one location to another is critical in everyday life, yet this vital ability declines with normal aging and can be further affected by conditions that disproportionately affect the elderly, such as vision loss or progressive dementia. Human and animal research has shown that two distinct memory systems interact during navigation. The first, referred to as allocentric navigation, is very flexible and uses spatial knowledge of key features or landmarks to develop and use a mental map of the environment. This approach involves brain regions that are critical for new learning and memory but that decline with age. The second, referred to as egocentric navigation, is inflexible and relies on ""habit"" memories that link specific features with specific directions. This approach relies on brain regions that are critical for ""automatic"" responses and that are relatively unaffected by age.

The main problem is that allocentric navigation declines with age and is accompanied increased dependence on egocentric navigation. This change increases the risk of becoming disoriented or ""lost"" when traveling in unfamiliar areas or even when traveling new routes in familiar areas. Therefore, the main goal of this project is to examine whether non-invasive brain stimulation, specifically transcranial direct current stimulation, can improve allocentric navigation in healthy older adults and patients with mild cognitive impairment.

Participants will complete two functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions while learning new environments. Before one of these sessions, participants will receive active brain stimulation over the parietal cortex. Before the other session, participants will receive sham brain stimulation over the parietal cortex. The effects of this stimulation will be evaluated using both an allocentric and an egocentric memory test.

These domains were: hygiene (7 items), dressing (5 items), continence (2 items), eating (3 items), meal preparation (3 items), telephoning (4 items), going on an outing (5 items), finance (4 items), medication (2 items), and leisure (5 items). The three responses to the DAD items were ""No, Yes, and N/A"". A ""No"" answer scored 0 and a ""Yes"" answer scored 1. The scoring range was 0-40, with a higher score indicating less disability (better quality of life). If N/A was selected then it was treated as missing. When there were items with missing values, the domain sub-scores and the total score were imputed. Domain sub-scores were summed to yield a total raw score.

PDC was designed to be a feasible and practical intervention to integrate health, community, and support services. PDC has a standardized protocol for care coordination and support services, including guidelines for care plan assessment, care plan development and implementation, ongoing monitoring, and reassessment. It also offers a structured training curriculum for providers and an operations manual for uniform implementation.

Objectives: The primary objective was to test the impact of PDC on outcomes for veterans with dementia and family caregivers. Two specific research objectives and corresponding hypotheses were addressed: 1. To test the impact of PDC on three categories of outcomes: psychosocial well-being outcomes (patient and caregiver effects); health care service use (patient effects only); and health care cost (patient effects only). HI:PDC, compared to usual care, will improve psychosocial well-being for patients with dementia and their caregivers. H2:PDC, compared to usual care, will reduce health care service use for patients with dementia. H3:PDC is preferred to usual care based on cost-benefit analyses. H4:The PDC intervention will be more effective in improving psychosocial well-being and reducing health care service use for patients and caregivers dealing with more severe patient impairment (e.g., cognitive status, functional status, and level of problem behaviors). 2. To evaluate the impact of PDC on role and intra-psychic strains caused by dementia and its care (patient and caregiver effects).

NCT01767909,The Study of Nasal Insulin in the Fight Against Forgetfulness (SNIFF),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01767909,,COMPLETED,"An urgent need exists to find effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can arrest or reverse the disease at its earliest stages. The emotional and financial burden of AD to patients, family members, and society is enormous, and is predicted to grow exponentially as the median population age increases. Current FDA-approved therapies are modestly effective at best. This study will examine a novel therapeutic approach using intranasal insulin (INI) that has shown promise in short-term clinical trials. If successful, information gained from the study has the potential to move INI forward rapidly as a therapy for AD. The study will also provide evidence for the mechanisms through which INI may produce benefits by examining key cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and hippocampal/entorhinal atrophy. These results will have considerable clinical and scientific significance, and provide therapeutically-relevant knowledge about insulin's effects on AD pathophysiology. Growing evidence has shown that insulin carries out multiple functions in the brain, and that insulin dysregulation may contribute to AD pathogenesis.

This study will examine the effects of intranasally-administered insulin on cognition, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild AD. It is hypothesized that after 12 months of treatment with INI compared to placebo, subjects will improve performance on a global measure of cognition, on a memory composite and on daily function. In addition to the examination of CSF biomarkers and hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy, the study aims to examine whether baseline AD biomarker profile, gender, or Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE-ε4) allele carriage predict treatment response.

In this study, 240 people with aMCI or AD will be given either INI or placebo for 12 months, following an open-label period of 6 months where all participants will be given active drug.

NCT01965756,Effect of Insulin Sensitizer Metformin on AD Biomarkers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01965756,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, affecting approximately 18 million people worldwide, including almost 500,000 in the Philadelphia tri-state area. After age 65, the incidence of AD rises exponentially, doubling every five years. By age 85, almost half of us will have AD. In 2030, as many as 7.7 million Americans could have AD, and by 2050 this number could rise to 11-16 million people. The annual cost of AD in the United States is about $200 billion. AD-related medical complications are among the most common causes of death in the elderly population. Despite these alarming statistics, a ""cure"" for AD may not be essential since delaying the onset of AD by just 5 years could have a profound impact on this disorder by reducing the incidence and cost of AD by 50% between now and 2050.

AD is difficult to recognize in its earliest stages, in which the principal complaint is typically an increase in episodes of forgetfulness. This stage is now commonly referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers have demonstrated good accuracy in predicting which MCI patients later ""convert"" to AD and which tend to remain stable or revert to more normal cognition. The diagnosis of AD itself is made when increased loss of memory and other cognitive abilities (eg, language, praxis, and executive function) affect daily functioning. As the symptoms of dementia inevitably worsen, patients may become incapable of even basic activities such as feeding and dressing themselves. The disease course often spans more than a decade, creating a vast social and financial burden on society and extracting an immeasurable emotional toll on family members.

IMP binds to amyloidal beta protein accumulating in brain tissue already from early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). IMP is therefore a potential tracer to be used for detecting amyloid plaques. For each subject it is required to visit the study centre during the screening phase, on the PET imaging day and for 1 follow-up visit on the next day. A telephone call for safety follow-up will be performed 7 days after IMP administration. During the screening phase the subject's medical, neurological and surgical history, specific laboratory tests related to AD, MRI of the brain and certain neuro-psychiatric tests will be performed. Clinical safety measures (physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory tests) will be performed on the PET imaging day before IMP injection and monitored during and after two PET imaging sessions.

NCT03461276,Safety and Immunogenicity of Repeated Doses of ABvac40 in Patients With a-MCI or Vm-AD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03461276,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 50-75% of the estimated 47 million people with dementia worldwide. The amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD proposes that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide accumulation in the brain, caused by an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance, is the initiating factor of a cascade ultimately leading to dementia.

Aβ peptides are generated from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), including Aβ40 and Aβ42. Aβ40 is the predominant variant (90%) among the secreted Aβ forms and although Aβ42 is more hydrophobic and prone to aggregate, and Aβ42 oligomers are regarded to be the most neurotoxic species, Aβ40 can also produce highly toxic diffusible aggregates, which can be prevented in vitro by specific anti-Aβ40 antibodies.

Several studies have proposed that a high concentration of Aβ40 in the brain distinguishes patients with AD from those who have senile plaques but are cognitively normal, pointing to the importance of Aβ40 in the onset of dementia. In keeping with this, previous studies have demonstrated that specific anti-Aβ40 antibodies label NFTs in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus of AD brains, and that these do not co-localize with tau NFTs, suggesting the presence of degenerating neuronal populations filled with C-terminal fragments of Aβx-40. In addition, Aβ40 is the main component of amyloid deposition around cerebral arteries causing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which has a prevalence of about 80-90% in patients with AD (for more information see Lacosta et al. Alzheimer's Research \& Therapy (2018) 10:12 DOI 10.1186/s13195-018-0340-8).

Considering those previous results suggesting that strategies targeting Aβ40 could represent novel disease-modifying therapies, we have developed ABvac40, the first active vaccine targeting the C-terminal end of the Aβ40 peptide.

The purpose of this Phase II study is to confirm in patients with a-MCI or vm-AD the level of safety and tolerability obtained in the ABvac40 Phase I clinical trial in patients with mm-AD. In addition, the study is aimed to better characterize the immune response elicited by ABvac40 and to explore its effects on AD biomarkers.",YES,Mild Cognitive Impairment|Alzheimer Disease,BIOLOGICAL: ABvac40|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo,"Average Maximal Increment of Anti-Aβ40 Antibody Signal (Optical Density [OD] in ELISA), Average maximal increment (MΔ) of plasma anti-Aβ40 antibody signal (optical density \[OD\] in ELISA) in each subject with regard to Baseline visit., Part A (Baseline, and post-Baseline visits at Week 2A, Week 6A, Week 10A, Week 14A, Week 18A, Week 24A, Week 40A, Week 44A, Week 50A, Week 77A, and Week 104A)","Subject Discontinuations Due to TEAEs, Number of withdrawn subjects due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the whole study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Physical Examination, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in physical examination reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Neurological Examination, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in neurological examination reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Analytical Hematology, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in hematology parameters reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Analytical Biochemistry, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in biochemistry parameters reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Coagulation, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in coagulation parameters reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Level of Anti-Aβ40 Antibodies in CSF, The change in levels of anti-Aβ40 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from baseline to each applicable post-baseline efficacy visit (Part A) was analyzed using a Mixed-Model Repeated Measures (MMRM), and the ITT analysis set.

NCT01876823,Memantine Plus Es-citalopram in Elderly Depressed Patients With Cognitive Impairment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01876823,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common dementing disorder of later life, is a major cause of disability and death in the elderly. Although a number of theoretical causes exist, the etiology of AD is still unknown. Consequently, the focus of treatments has been palliative, designed to ameliorate AD symptoms. Recent efforts, however, have revealed some surprising data suggesting that cholinesterase inhibitors (AchEIs), used over the last decade, and recently released memantine (an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist), may confer protection to neurons. Thus, they may offer a slowing of cognitive decline and/or improvement in behavioral symptoms associated with memory impairment.

Over the last decade, it has been well documented that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) increases the risk of conversion to AD and that coincident depression and MCI (Dep-MCI) further increases the risk 2 to 3 fold. The primary focus of this line of investigation is to treat the very high risk to dement patient population with Dep-MCI, before they develop AD, in the hopes of delaying AD onset.

Memantine had not been studied in DEP-MCI patients. Since treatment of these patients with combined antidepressant and AChEIs has been associated with cognitive improvement in pilot studies, we explore whether treatment of DEP-MCI with memantine in addition to antidepressant treatment would benefit cognitive performance and lead to a low rate of conversion to dementia.

Existing research recruitment approaches are rarely designed to accommodate the priorities, concerns, and constraints relevant to participants from diverse backgrounds. To address these gaps, the investigators developed a research recruitment and engagement model, the Participant Oriented Research Engagement Model that centers and prioritizes relational aspects of research engagement, research participant needs, and systematically address socioeconomic determinants (i.e. unmet needs) that may limit accessibility of research. The investigators propose to test the effectiveness of the Brain Health Community (BHC) Registry recruitment and engagement intervention, as compared to standard research recruitment strategies in modifying enrollment rates, participant satisfaction, and engagement.

Two thirds of the US adult population are at risk for hyperinsulinemia and T2D, and half of the population 85 years and older have AD. Peripheral hyperinsulinemia can impair the clearance of amyloid beta in the brain, the main culprit in AD. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that lowering peripheral insulin in overweight persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AMCI), a transition state between normal cognition and AD, can decrease the risk of cognitive decline and progression to AD. The investigators propose to conduct a phase II double blinded placebo controlled randomized clinical trial of metformin, a safe and effective medication that prevents hyperinsulinemia and diabetes, to test this hypothesis among 80 overweight persons aged 55 to 90 years with AMCI.

Changes in the numbers of I2BS in post mortem tissue has implicated them in a range of psychiatric conditions such as depression and addiction, along with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's chorea. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated functional interactions with the opioid system, where I2BS ligands have been shown to affect tolerance to morphine and alleviate some of the morphine withdrawal syndrome in rats. Recently the I2BS and I2BS ligands have been shown to have some interesting analgesic effects in different models of pain and a novel I2BS ligand, CR4056, is currently undergoing Phase II clinical trials as a novel treatment for neuropathic pain and acute non- specific pain states.

The location of I2BS on astrocytic glial cells and the possibility that they may in some way regulate glial fibrillary acidic protein have led to increased interest into the role of I2BS and I2BS ligands in conditions characterised by marked gliosis. The number of I2BS has been shown to increase in Alzheimer's disease post mortem, and it has also been suggested that I2BS may be a marker for the severity and malignancy of human glioblastomas.

The lack of suitable imaging tools for the I2BS has meant that information regarding the number and distribution of I2BS in the brain has come from preclinical species and in vitro post-mortem studies. The recent development of \[11C\]BU99008 as a suitable PET ligand to quantify I2BS in vivo, enables the direct quantification of I2BS availability and regional distribution in the living human brain.

NCT05216315,tDCS and Cognitive Efficiency in Ageing,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05216315,FRtDCS,COMPLETED,"Normal aging is associated with a progressive decline in cognitive functions, especially memory. This decline in cognitive function can negatively impact the quality of life of older adults. Although there are currently few possibilities to prevent and/or slow the signs of cognitive decline, both those associated with age and neurodegenerative pathologies, one of the non-invasive brain stimulation techniques that has gained attention in recent years is Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS). tDCS is a technique based on the application of a low-intensity (\< 2 mA) direct electrical current between two large-area electrodes placed on various surface areas of the head. Moreover, according to safety-related meta-analyses it is a very safe technique, without any major side effects, provided that internationally established safety protocols are taken into account in its application. This technique has recently been investigated as a potential treatment for both healthy elderly people and people with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease in several cognitive variables, having shown encouraging results in working memory learning curves, modulation of plasticity and recognition tasks. This project aims to implement an intervention using transcranial direct current stimulation in healthy older adults, MCI and AD. The main objective is to test if there is an improvement in cognitive efficiency and if the changes are maintained over time (1 month). For this purpose, the effect of the technique will be studied on participants assigned to treatment and control groups, analyzing the possible modifications in the following cognitive variables: cognitive plasticity and learning potential, recognition and familiarity and false alarms.",YES,Aging|Mild Cognitive Impairment|Alzheimer Disease,DEVICE: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)|DEVICE: Sham stimulation,"Complutense Verbal Learning Test (TAVEC) - Memory, This test presents a list of 16 words that, after being read by the evaluator, have to be repeated by the participant.

Each item asks about a problem the care recipient is experiencing. For each problem the care recipient experiences, caregivers are asked to rate how much the problem upsets the caregiver on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). Scores for caregiver reaction are calculated by taking the sum of the individual items. Total scores can range from 0 to 96, with higher scores reflect caregivers being more upset when memory and behavior problems happen.

We report the change in scores by subtracting the total score at baseline from the total score at 6 weeks. The possible range for the change in total scores is from -96 to 96.

It relies on both direct examination of the participant and an interview of the informant. The instrument consisted of 3 parts: a guided baseline interview administered to the participant and an informant, a follow-up interview administered to the participant and an informant, and a clinician's rating review. The baseline interview served as a reference for future ratings. During the baseline interview, the rater evaluated participant regarding domains of (1) sleep and wake symptoms; (2) mood and behavioral symptoms; (3) attention/arousal; and (4) social functioning. In the follow-up interview, a 7-pointscale was used, from 1 = marked improvement, 4 = no change, to 7 = marked worsening, to score each of the 4 domains and to provide a global score (1 \[marked improvement\] to 7 \[marked worsening\])., Day 29|Core Phase: Change From Baseline in the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-10) Total Score at Day 29, The NPI-10 assessed a wide range of behaviors seen in dementia for both frequency and severity. It is a 10 item questionnaire with the following domains: delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety, elation/euphoria, apathy/indifference, disinhibition, irritability/liability and aberrant motor behavior. The total score was summarized and analyzed. This scale was administered with the caregiver as proxy for the participant. The total score was a sum of the 10 domains, where the score of each domain was calculated as frequency (scale: 1=occasionally to 4=very frequently) \* Severity (scale: 1=Mild to 3=Severe). Each domain has a maximum score of 12 and all domains were equally weighted for total score, thus the range for the total score is 0 to 120 with 0 being completely healthy to 120 which is the worse score participant could get., Baseline, Day 29|Core Phase: Change From Baseline in the Sleep Disorders Inventory (SDI) Score at Day 29, The SDI is an expanded version of one item of the NPI. It described the frequency, severity, and caregiver burden of sleep-disturbed behaviors during a period prior to its administration. The SDI consists of the 7 sub questions relating to sleep from the NPI sleep disturbance item. Each of the sub questions is a separate question with frequency, severity, and caregiver distress rated by the caregiver with respect to the patient-participant for the 2 weeks prior to the visit. The SDI score is derived as the product of the average of the frequency ratings and the average of the severity ratings (range: 0-12 \[worst\])., Baseline, Day 29|Extension Phase: Change From Baseline in SDI Total Score., The SDI is an expanded version of one item of the NPI. It described the frequency, severity, and caregiver burden of sleep-disturbed behaviors during a period prior to its administration.

The goal of this intervention is to reduce upsetting behaviors and care partner burden. Caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD) can come with many burdens that affect not only the care partners' physical and psychological health but also barriers to access. Due to factors such as distance and cost, Internet-based interventions like STELLA are a great alternative to in-person interventions because it can still address the specific needs of families living with dementia. The hypothesis of this study is that care partners will show significant improvements in burden and depression following the intervention. STELLA is also designed to facilitate effective management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). To accomplish this, up to 40 care partners and their 40 care recipients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias will participate in an 8-week intervention with the support of a Guide (e.g. nurse or social worker). However, the primary focus of this study is on care partners. With the support of a Guide, care partners will identify strategies to address upsetting behaviors in the moderate to late stages of dementia.

NCT04235374,Implementation of Function Focused Care in Acute Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04235374,,COMPLETED,"Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25% of hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline, delirium, falls, behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of stay. Physical activity during hospitalization (e.g., mobility,bathing, dressing) has a positive impact on older adults including prevention of functional decline, less pain, less delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased unplanned hospital readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and older hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to increasing physical activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD; inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and prevents falls; and lack of motivation/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute Care (FFC-AC-EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is provided by having nurses teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT was developed using a social ecological model, social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle. It involves a four-step approach that includes: (1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2) Education; (3) Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff, Patients and Families. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT within 12 hospitals in Maryland and Pennsylvania randomized to FFC-AC-EIT or Function Focused Care Education Only (EO) with 50 patients recruited per hospital (total sample 600 patients). Aim 1 will focus on efficacy at the patient level based primarily on physical activity, function, and participation in function focused care, and secondarily on delirium, BPSD, pain, falls, use of tethers, and length of stay; and all of these outcomes (except length of stay and tethers) along with emergency room visits, re-hospitalizations and new long term care admissions at 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge; and at the unit level the aim is to evaluate the impact of FFC-AC-EIT on policies and environments that facilitate function and physical activity at 6, 12 and 18 months post implementation. Hospitals randomized to FFC-AC-EIT will be compared with those randomized to Function Focused Care Education Only (EO). Aim 2 will evaluate the feasibility, based on treatment fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment)136, and relative cost and cost savings of FFC-AC-EIT versus EO.

NCT03451591,LACunar Intervention (LACI-2) Trial-2,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03451591,LACI-2,COMPLETED,"About 35,000 people each year in the UK have a type of stroke, called 'lacunar' or 'small vessel' stroke, which is different to other common types of stroke and for which there is no proven treatment. It is thought that small vessel stroke is caused by damage to the lining of the tiny blood vessels deep inside the brain that stops them functioning normally. This not only causes stroke but, perhaps more importantly, causes problems with thinking and walking, possibly causing up to 45% of all dementias either on its own, or mixed with Alzheimer's disease (about 350,000 patients in the UK). Some drugs that are commonly used in other blood vessel diseases may help improve small vessel function and prevent worsening of brain damage. One drug (cilostazol) has been tested in patients with stroke in the Asia Pacific countries but not on dementia; the other drug (isosorbide mononitrate) is widely used in the UK for heart disease but not stroke. The investigators want to set up a clinical trial to test if the study methods are practical so that patients and trial centres can follow the procedures, and to confirm how many patients have more stroke-like symptoms or experience worsening of their thinking skills.

Odor (olfactory) identification deficits may reflect degeneration of cholinergic inputs to the olfactory bulb and other olfactory brain regions. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACheI) like donepezil show modest effects in improving cognition but can be associated with adverse effects and increased burden and costs because of the need for prolonged, often lifelong, treatment. Converging findings on odor identification test performance (UPSIT, scratch and sniff 40-item test) from four pilot studies, including two of our own, suggest that acute change in the UPSIT in response to an anticholinergic challenge (atropine nasal spray), incremental change over 8 weeks, and even the baseline UPSIT score by itself, may predict cognitive improvement with ACheI treatment in MCI and AD.

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.

NCT05721482,Stress and Hypertension in Dementia Caregivers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05721482,MIM-DASH,COMPLETED,"No demographic group is more at risk for the double jeopardy of caregiving stress and hypertension (HTN) than African American women caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Both situations lead to reduced quality of life and cardiovascular disease-a complication of uncontrolled hypertension. Maintaining the health of these caregivers is critical to support the well-being of the care recipients. Although some multi-component interventions have addressed ADRD caregiver's stress and quality of life, gaps remain in targeting interventions to address the complexity of chronic caregiving stress and hypertension self-care in African American women.

This pilot study builds on the investigator's earlier work which showed that stress, blood pressure knowledge, and complex diet information deficits all interfered with older African American women's hypertension self-care. Lifestyle changes (stress management, reducing sodium, eating fruits/vegetables, and physical activity) are effective in managing hypertension. The investigator's Stage I pilot study is based on the scientific rationale that these lifestyle changes can be promoted by addressing stress reactivity/stress resilience, the psychological and physiological response of the body to stress, as the underlying mechanism to facilitate behavioral change. In this way the study can improve health outcomes (caregiver stress, quality of life, cardiovascular disease risk).",YES,"Hypertension|Stress, Psychological",BEHAVIORAL: Caregiver Training,"Change in Blood Pressure (Systolic), Change is being assessed in systolic blood pressure measured with an automatic blood pressure cuff.

The design of this study is guided by two overriding factors: 1) to optimize the performance of the ALTOIDA™ Neuro Motor Index (NMI) prognosis classifiers, the subjects making up the training sets must be well characterized as to their clinical diagnosis, and 2) all ALTOIDA™ tests must be performed and reproduced in real-world clinical settings.

Although there is already a large body of peer-reviewed scientific literature demonstrating that certain digital biomarker patterns are associated with certain neurologic conditions, the utilization of such tools for the evaluation of neurologic disorders is still considered an emerging science and therefore in the investigational stage. Although this protocol will report on brain patterns of certain neurologic conditions such as cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, based on patterns published in peer-reviewed journals, such findings are not considered stand alone or diagnostic per se and should always be considered by the primary physician in conjunction with the patient's clinical condition.

NCT03550131,Innovations in Dementia Empowerment and Action,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03550131,IDEA,COMPLETED,"The lack of efficacious research-based interventions for such vulnerable older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (AD/RD) and their caregivers (CGs) is a significant public health problem. Caregiving of sexual/gender minority older adults with AD/RD is of concern due to social stigma, marginalization, and isolation, which may be barriers to sustaining caregiving. It is necessary and timely to translate evidence-based culturally adaptable interventions for this underserved and stigmatized population. Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD) has been evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and has shown to successfully train community-dwelling CR (care receiver)-CG dyads to increase the physical activity and functioning of individuals with AD/RD and their CGs and to teach CGs techniques for managing behavioral symptoms of CRs. RDAD consequently decreases stress of CGs, delays institutionalization of CRs, and increases health related quality of life (HRQOL) of CRs and CGs. Thus, this study will evaluate the effect of the standard RDAD among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) CRs with AD/RD and their CGs, and this study will test a personalized intervention tailored to better respond to distinct risks experienced by CGs and LGBT CRs with AD/RD, addressing unique sexual/gender minority CG risk factors (e.g., identity management, stigma-related adverse or traumatic life events, and lack of social support).",YES,Alzheimer Disease|Dementia|Mild Cognitive Impairment|Parkinson Disease Dementia|Lewy Body Dementia|Vascular Dementia,BEHAVIORAL: Innovations in Dementia Empowerment and Action (IDEA)|BEHAVIORAL: Reducing Disabilities in Alzheimer's Disease (RDAD),"Change in Physical Activity of Care Recipient, Measured by the days of aerobic activity for at least 30 minutes in the past week with higher numbers indicating more days of activity., Baseline, 6 weeks(pre-treatment), 13 weeks(post-treatment), 30 weeks, 13 months","Depression of Care Partner: Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD-10), Assessed using the summed score on the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale (CESD-10).

NCT03932812,Building a Bridge (BAB) Between Clinical and Community Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03932812,BAB,COMPLETED,"Dementia diagnosis triggers a transitional phase for the individuals and their families, often causing emotional distress and family conflicts due to the ambiguity of the illness and future trajectories. Families often report a lack of information and guidance during the period immediately following diagnosis, suggesting a missed opportunity for prevention of family distress at the outset of the caregiver and patient career. With large and increasing numbers of individuals newly diagnosed with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) each year, there is an urgent need to develop effective intervention models to support role transitions and minimize distress related to ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to minimize negative consequences of ADRD by enhancing the support systems of the affected families as they start their new and challenging phase of life as patients and family caregivers. The aim of this research is to evaluate the impact of this new Options Counselor-Health Education (OC-HE) intervention on bridging the medical and community-settings through potential mechanisms of influence, enhancement of social networks and support. Implementation strategies will be developed in collaboration with partnering clinics and local Area Agencies on Aging. Participants will be recruited from three clinics at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC) that provide dementia diagnostic services and randomized into an intervention or control arm; and complete baseline and three- and six-month follow-up interviews. This study is innovative in its consideration of contributing factors at multiple levels of the ecological model (i.e., individual, social network, and organizational) and its collaborative approach, involving medical clinics, an Area Agency on Aging (AAA), and Alzheimer's Association (AA) to develop and evaluate a new care model that bridges between the medical and community settings.",YES,Caregiver Burden,BEHAVIORAL: Options Counselor Health Educator (OC-HE) Intervention,"Modified Zarit Burden Interview, Caregiver burden 12 item self report questionnaire; Minimum score 0, maximum score 36 with low scores showing less burden, Change over time from baseline to 6-month","Knowledge of Formal Services, Established measure of the extent to which caregiver knows about formal services available in their communities.

The drug empagliflozin treats diabetes. It lowers blood sugar by increasing glucose the kidneys excrete. This increases levels of ketones formed in the blood. The body makes ketones when it does not have enough glucose for fuel. The brains of many people with age-related diseases like Alzheimer's do not use glucose well. Brain use of ketones might improve mental ability. We investigated how empagliflozin affects ketone levels, which could lead to ways to improve brain health as people age.

Objectives:

To study how taking empagliflozin affects systemic and brain metabolism including ketone levels in people without diabetes.

Eligibility:

Adults at least 55 years old without diabetes

Design:

After a screening Visit, eligible participants were admitted to the NIA Clinical Unit during Visits 1 (baseline), 2 (first dose) and 3 (last/14th dose). On each Visit, blood draws were performed and circulating metabolites and hormones were repeatedly measured over 34-hour periods. Using plasma from fasting state only, we isolated total and neuronal-origin extracellular vesicles to measure proteins of the IGF-1 and insulin signaling cascades. Furthermore, on each Visit, we performed magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure concentrations of a plethora of metabolites in the brain. Between Visits 2 and 3, participants were taking the drug at home. A continuous glucose monitoring device was placed to detect potential glucose fluctuations while at home.

If both members of the dyad endorse ""I am not sure"", they are considered incongruent., Baseline, follow up phone call at 2-3 days post-intervention|Surrogate's Decision Making Confidence (DMC) Scale Score Among Phase II Participants, Surrogate decision-making confidence is measured using the 5-item Decision Making Confidence (DMC) scale. DMC assesses a surrogate's confidence in knowing the patient's wishes, ability to make treatment decisions even in a highly stressful situation, ability to seek information about risks and benefits of medical choices, ability to handle unwanted pressure from others, and ability to communicate with providers about the patient's wishes. Surrogates indicate how confident they are about making medical decisions, if the patient becomes unable to make their own decisions, by their level of agreement with statements along a scale of (0) ""not confident at all"" to (4) ""Very confident"".

After 12 weeks of PBM treatments, delivered with a commercially available, wearable device, the patients with mild to moderately severe dementia showed improvements on the Mini-mental State Exam (MMSE, p\<0.003) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive, ADAS-cog, p\<0.03). The caregivers, who kept daily journals of their experiences during the 12 weeks of PBM treatment, reported better sleep, fewer angry outbursts, decreased anxiety and wandering in their loved-ones with dementia. The goals of this trial are to: (1) replicate this finding in a larger group of individuals with dementia and (2) to examine the underling brain mechanisms behind the changes in cognitive function.",YES,"Dementia, Alzheimer Type",DEVICE: Vielight Neuro Gamma,"Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog), The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-cog) test is one of the most frequently used tests to measure cognition in research studies and clinical trials for new drugs and other interventions. It consists of 11 tasks measuring the disturbances of memory, language, praxis (e.g., ability to conceptualize, plan, and execute the complex sequences of motor actions), attention and other cognitive abilities which are often referred to as the core symptoms of AD. The ADAS-cog score is based on the number of errors made in each item. Total score ranges from 0 to 70. A score of 70 represents the most severe impairment. A score of 0 represents the least impairment.

This outcome is a change score, derived by subtracting Baseline ADAS-cog score from Week 12 ADAS-cog score., change from baseline to 12 weeks|Change in Clock-drawing Test, The clock-drawing test is used for screening for cognitive impairment and dementia and as a measure of spatial dysfunction and neglect.

This outcome consists of the strength of the connection between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a hub of the DMN, and the left (L) and right (R) lateral parietal cortex (LP) at baseline and at Week 12. Studies in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggest there is diminished connectivity between nodes of the DMN in AD. Therefore increased connectivity between nodes of the DMN from baseline to Week 12 (or higher T-scores of the connection) indicate better outcomes.

Thus, there is a need to implement evidence-based models of care to improve function and those factors that support function in older adults living in the community. One such model is CAPABLE (Community Aging in Place Advancing Better Living for Elders), a person-centered, nurse and occupational therapy intervention supported by assistive devices and home modifications. The investigators build on prior work that translated CAPABLE and conducted preliminary testing of a package of implementation strategies. This R15 application will test site-level adoption and sustainability after deploying a package of implementation strategies (readiness assessment, training, facilitation, champions, coalition building, and audit and feedback). Sites will be randomized to internal facilitation alone or internal facilitation plus external facilitation. This work will impact implementation science by testing two approaches to implementation of an evidence-based intervention to improve outcomes among older adults in a Medicaid Waiver program.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPLEMENT We extend the Parent Trial by addressing a problem found while deploying CAPABLE with beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia. There are 39.8 million informal caregivers in the US and 16.3 million who care for someone with AD or dementia; and 1,500 of those are in the Michigan waiver. Most beneficiaries with those conditions did not accept CAPABLE as they were unable to receive instruction. Interventions that improve caregiver knowledge, confidence, and self-efficacy improve care they provide. Thus, the goal is to extend provision of CAPABLE to beneficiaries with AD or dementia via the engagement of their informal caregivers. This work is significant as there are 1,500 beneficiaries with AD or dementia in the waiver who could benefit from CAPABLE yet many did not, as they were to receive instructions. To date, CAPABLE has only been designed to be used directly with the individuals without caregiver involvement. In the waiver, beneficiaries are required to have a designated caregiver, therefore, modifying the toolkit for use by caregivers could aid in deploying CAPABLE to beneficiaries with AD or dementia.",YES,Independent Living,BEHAVIORAL: MiCAP with IF (Main Study)|BEHAVIORAL: MiCAP with IF and EF (Main Study)|BEHAVIORAL: MiCAP with IF and Caregiver Engagement (Administrative Supplement),"Main Study: Effect of MiCAP With IF Alone Versus MiCAP With IF+EF on Site-level Outcomes of Adoption and Sustainability of CAPABLE, Adoptions and sustainability of the intervention using the Stages of Implementation Completion (SIC) at a site (18). SIC is a tool that tracks achievement of key activities when implementing an evidence-based intervention.

SIC has 6 stages with multiple implementation activities; each activity had an assigned numeric value and when a activity was completed, a score was assigned. The \*total\* SIC score ranges from 0-100. Stage 1 score range 0-12. Stage 2 0-16. Stage 3 0-24. Stage 4 0-16. Stage 5 0-16. Stage 6 0-16. The \*total\* score was calculated by summing the points of each stage. The higher the \*total\* score, the more implementation activities were completed.

For the below reported \*total\* score, each waiver site had their \*total\* SIC score numerically calculated.

The Tobacco Treatment Guidelines underscore the need to offer patients who use tobacco products brief interventions that include prescriptions for proven pharmacological smoking cessation aids and proactive connections to evidence-based behavioral support. The rapid expansion of smart phone capabilities enhances the potential for tobacco cessation apps to personalize behavior change guidance and to send contextually relevant tailored behavior change nudges based on readiness to quit and electronic heath record (EHR) data. Rich data from EHRs are now available to third-party apps from the Health app (iOS) via Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard Application Programming Interface (API).

This Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) explored the effects of one such innovative health IT solution. refresh is a highly individualized tobacco cessation HealthKit enabled app that 1) implemented a full range of best practices in tailored health behavior change communications based on readiness to change; 2) provided individualized behavior change guidance based on Health app data; and 3) concisely provided data and documentation of key actionable insights in the EHR on the patient's smoking status, app usage, and brief micro-message delivered by clinicians to reinforce and accelerate a patient's behavior change progress. This interoperability provided value to both patients and clinicians; empowered and supported successful and lasting behavior change; and enabled the implementation and evaluation of a best-in-class approach to tobacco and nicotine treatment.

Extensive end user and stakeholder input ensured that refresh was designed for rapid dissemination. Patients of an integrated delivery system with an upcoming appointment (n=51) were recruited to participate in a 30-day pilot test. Pre-post comparisons of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) measure for tobacco (psychosocial expectancies) and confidence for quitting provided preliminary data on the effects of the program.

The primary goal of this Phase II STTR proposal is to further define user requirements and product specifications and develop a prototype of VidaTalk, a patient-centric, touch pad communication software, to provide mechanically ventilated (MV) patients an evidence-based solution for effectively communicating their needs to care providers and family. A secondary goal is to test the impact of the VidaTalk on clinical outcomes. This study will use mixed methods including observations and interaction with hospitalized patients as they use the VidaTalk tool, surveys and medical record data extraction, product evaluation and brief interview, satisfaction surveys with family members of ICU patients, and focus groups with Registered Nurses.

Specific Aim 1. Develop a commercial prototype of VidaTalk that will include multilingual and customizable messages, compatibility with tablet devices, picture symbols, and integration with mobile communication devices.

Specific Aim 2. Demonstrate usability with iterative user assessment testing in a clinical setting.

Specific Aim 3. Test the clinical efficacy of VidaTalk via android application with MV patients by examining qualitative and quantitative endpoints in a clinical setting. Aim 3 hypothesis: MV patients using VidaTalk will demonstrate significant reductions in patient-reported communication difficulty and frustration, anxiety, sedation exposure, delirium/coma-free days, and improved patient and family satisfaction with ICU care compared to MV patients receiving attention-control (i.e., tablets with health education application).

The conditioning regimen helps to kill the abnormal cells in the body and makes room in the bone marrow for new blood stem cells to grow. 4) Stem Cell Infusion

Participants in this study will have an additional treatment step called ""induction therapy"", designed as the first step towards reducing the number of abnormal cells in the body. Two cycles of the investigational drugs bortezomib and dexamethasone will be given during induction therapy.

All patients who enroll in this extension study will receive once-daily oral 20 mg Fx-1006A for 12 months; therefore, patients randomized to placebo in Study Fx-005 will cross over to active drug (Fx-1006A 20 mg) during this study. However, patients and their families as well as clinical Investigators and their clinical site staff will remain blinded to the original Fx-005 treatment assignment. It is intended that there will be no interruption in study medication administration between the two studies. The majority of safety and clinical outcomes assessments will be identical to those evaluated in Study Fx-005. Additional assessments for this open-label extension study include 24-hour Holter monitoring and skin biopsy for IENF; patients will be required to provide written informed consent to participate in this open-label extension study prior to having these additional procedures performed.

The values obtained from procedures and evaluations conducted during the Month 18 visit of Study Fx-005 will be used as the Baseline values for this open-label extension study. The Baseline assessments of IENF and Holter monitoring may be conducted at either day of the Month 18 visit days of Study Fx-005, but prior to the first Fx-1006A dose in this open-label extension study. Clinic Visits will be conducted at Week 6 (± 2 days), and Month 3 (± 1 week), Month 6 (± 2 weeks), and Month 12 (± 2 weeks). Monthly telephone contacts (± 1 week of the scheduled date) will be made during months in which no investigative site visits are scheduled (Months 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) for assessment of adverse events and concomitant medications.

Neurological evaluation by NIS-LL will be performed at Months 6 and 12. The NIS-LL will be assessed by utilizing the average of two successive NIS-LL clinical assessment scores obtained at least 24 hours apart within a one week period for each study visit. A dedicated neurologist will be required to perform NIS-LL scoring across all time-points for each individual patient enrolled in the study.

Quality of life utilizing the Norfolk QOL-DN will be assessed at Months 6 and 12 (based on the total score as well as the five individual domains of the questionnaire).

QST (utilizing CASE IV), NCS, HRDB, mBMI, and echocardiography will be conducted at Months 6 and 12. Holter monitoring will be conducted at Baseline and Months 6 and 12. Biopsies for IENF will be obtained at Baseline only. Assessments of troponin I and NT-pro-BNP levels will be made at each study visit.

Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments (Fx-1006A concentrations as well as calculated steady-state parameters) and pharmacodynamic assessments (TTR stabilization) will be collected at Week 6 and Months 6 and 12.

Safety and tolerability will be assessed throughout the study. Vital signs, 12-lead ECG, blood and urine samples for clinical laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, coagulation panel, urinalysis, and urine pregnancy testing), adverse events, and concomitant medications will be assessed at each study visit. Eye examinations (including fundal photography) will be conducted at Months 6 and 12. Abbreviated physical examinations will be conducted at Week 6, and Months 3 and 6, and a complete physical examination will be conducted at Month 12.

All patients will be contacted by telephone 30 days (± 1 week) after the last dose of study medication for assessment of adverse events and concomitant medications.

Patients who complete the Month 12 visit of this open-label study may be allowed to continue receiving Fx-1006A under a compassionate use program.

Patients who discontinue from the study at any time after enrollment (i.e., early termination) will have final safety assessments performed at the time of discontinuation.

Deposition of TTR amyloid is associated with a variety of human diseases. Deposition of amyloid fibrils of variant TTR (primarily V30M) in peripheral nerve tissue produces the condition called FAP.

The prevention of the formation of amyloid by stabilization of the TTR native state should constitute an effective therapy for amyloid diseases. Therapeutic intervention with a TTR stabilizer drug, such as Fx-1006A, is hypothesized to stop progression of the disease in FAP patients. FAP is a uniformly fatal disease and Fx-1006A is intended to halt the relentless neurological deterioration FAP patients experience.

This Phase 2/3 study will enroll early to mid-stage FAP patients in order to interrupt and stabilize the disease at a point in time where progression of motor and autonomic dysfunction can be maximally effected.

The method combines all-cause mortality, cumulative frequency of CV-related hospitalizations, change from baseline in NT-proBNP and change from baseline in 6MWT in a hierarchical fashion. The method compares every participant with every other participant within strata, assigning a +1 to the ""better"" participant and a -1 to the ""worse"" participant and 0 if they are ""tied"". Participants who had heart transplantation or implantation of a cardiac mechanical assist device were handled in the same manner as death.
