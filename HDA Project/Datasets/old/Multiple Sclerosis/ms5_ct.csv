\- The Idebenone in Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS) trial tested a new drug for multiple sclerosis. In the IPPoMS trial, participants took either idebenone or placebo. Researchers want to give idebenone to all participants for 1 year. It is still not certain whether idebenone can slow the progression of multiple sclerosis, but this study may help answer that question.

Objectives:

* To provide idebenone to all participants on the IPPoMS trial.
* To collect data on the safety and effectiveness of idebenone for primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

Eligibility:

\- Individuals at least 18 years of age who have completed 3 years in the IPPoMS trial.

Design:

* The first study visit for this trial will happen on the same day as the last visit for the IPPoMS trial.
* Participants will provide a blood samples and will have a lumbar puncture. They will also receive a new supply of idebenone to take three times a day with food. They will keep a diary to report on any side effects.
* After this first treatment visit, participants will have two follow-up visits to the NIH 6 months apart. These visits may be scheduled over multiple days. Participants will provide blood and urine samples. They will also have imaging studies of the brain and spine.
* Participants will have phone calls with the study researchers to provide updates on their condition and any side effects.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis|Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Idebenone,"Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Combinatorial Weight-Adjusted Disability Score (CombiWISE), CombiWISE is a composite scale derived from Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) , Scripps Neurological Disability Scale (SNRS), times 25 foot walk (25FW), and non-dominant hand of 9 hole peg test (9HPT) with a minimum value of 0 (no disability) and maximum value of 100 (maximum disability).

NCT00950248,Clinical Trial of Idebenone in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00950248,IPPoMS,COMPLETED,"Background:

* Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that progressively weakens and destroys the pathways of the nervous system. About 10 percent to 15 percent of patients develop primary-progressive MS (PP-MS), characterized by progressive accumulation of disability from the disease onset, without any marked improvements or relapses. There are currently no effective treatments for PP-MS.
* Idebenone is a manmade drug that is similar to a naturally occurring compound known as coenzyme Q10, a common dietary supplement. Research data suggest that idebenone may be able to limit demyelination and death of brain cells and thereby slow or halt the progression of neurological dysfunction such as that occurring in MS.

Objectives:

\- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using idebenone to treat primary progressive MS.

Eligibility:

\- Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have been diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

Design:

* The study will last 3 years and will be divided into two parts: a 1-year pretreatment baseline and 2 years of treatment with either idebenone or a placebo.
* Pre-treatment study: approximately 5 clinic visits over 1 year.
* Visit 1: Comprehensive medical history and neurological examination, with brain scans and neurological tests.
* Visit 2: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine and lymphocytapheresis (withdrawal of white blood cells for testing).
* Visit 3: Lumbar puncture.
* Visit 4: Skin biopsy.
* Visit 5: Repeat MRI of the brain and spinal cord, as well as neurological tests; these tests will be scheduled over 2 days.
* After the five pretreatment visits, patients will receive a 6-month supply of study medication (either idebenone or a placebo) to take three times a day with food
* Patients will continue to have regular followup clinic visits with brain MRI scans, blood tests, and other evaluations of brain and nervous system function.

It is composed of 8 health domains: Physical Functioning, Role-Physical, Bodily Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role-Emotional, and Mental Health. The PCS score was derived based on the SF-36 V2 User's Manual. Scoring for PCS involves (a) recoding item response values, (b) summing recoded response values for all items in a given scale to obtain the scale raw score, (c) transforming scale raw score to a 0-100 score. The PCS score was computed by (a) multiplying each health domain z score by a scale-specific physical factor score coefficient, (b) summing the resulting products, (c) converting the product total to T score. The total score ranges from 0-100, higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability., From Baseline to Week 120|Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event (AE), AEs included infusion related reactions (IRRs) and serious multiple sclerosis (MS) relapses, but excluded non-serious MS relapses., From baseline to 9 years",,Hoffmann-La Roche,,ALL,ADULT,PHASE3,735,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",WA25046|2010-020338-25,2011-03-02,2015-07-23,2022-12-31,2010-09-03,2017-12-26,2024-01-10,"Phoenix Neurological Associates Ltd, Phoenix, Arizona, 85006, United States|Barrow Neurology Clinic, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|Mayo Clinic- Scottsdale, Scottsdale, Arizona, 85259, United States|Arizona Neuroscience Research LLC, Phoenix, Arkansas, 85032-2181, United States|Sutter East Bay Medical Foundation, Berkeley, California, 94705, United States|MS Center of Southern California, Newport Beach, California, 92663, United States|Univ of CA Davis Med Ctr; Neurology, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Univ of CA San Francisco; Department of Neurology, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|University of Colorado; Anschutz Medical Campus Department of Neurology, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|University of Miami School of Medicine; Dept. of Neurology Movement Disorder Center, Miami, Florida, 33136, United States|Vero Beach Neurology and Research Institute, Vero Beach, Florida, 32960, United States|Indiana University Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States|University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160, United States|MidAmerica Neuroscience Institute, Prairie Village, Kansas, 66206, United States|Wayne State University; Department of Neurology, Detroit, Michigan, 48201, United States|Henry Ford Health System; Neurology & Neurosurgery, Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|Michigan Institute for Neurological Disorders, Farmington Hills, Michigan, 48334, United States|University of Minnesota; Clin.

NCT02208050,A Study of the Effectiveness of Fampridine in Improving Upper Limb Function in MS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02208050,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of treatment with fampridine in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS) with upper limb dysfunction (as defined by a 9-HPT time of between 15-90 seconds) and Kurtzke EDSS scores in the range 4.0-7.0 on upper limb function assessed by the nine-hole peg test (9-HPT) and the Jebson Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT).

Fampridine has been shown to be effective in improving motor function, specifically walking ability in prior studies in this patient population and is currently licensed for this use in Europe and the United States. Upper limb dysfunction is common in SPMS and PPMS and often underestimated. Fampridine effects action potential conduction in demyelinated nerve fibres and we would hypothesise that the improvement previously reported in walking ability would be similar to that on upper limb dysfunction. Our study aims to address this question using both independent and patient reported outcomes in the context of a randomised placebo controlled crossover trial.",YES,Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis|Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Fampridine|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants Classified as Upper Limb Responders on the 9 Hole Peg Test (9HPT), 9 Hole Peg Test is a test of upper limb function. Participants place 9 pegs on pegboard and remove pegs - this is timed for each hand. Time recorded in seconds.

RELAXaHEAD app incorporates the electronic PMR that was successfully used in an earlier epilepsy study and beta tested with headache specialist and migraine patient input. It also is an electric headache diary. The app has been studied and findings have been reported in multiple peer reviewed publications. Also, the app has been updated based on prior feedback from the studies. Now, this 2-arm randomized controlled study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of RELAXaHEAD for use with patients with migraine and comorbid insomnia. . One arm will be the RELAX group (the RELAXaHEAD app) and the other arm will be a monitored usual care (MUC) group (this group receives standard of care and uses the electronic daily symptom reporting diary). The goals are to assess the feasibility and adherence of the RELAX intervention in persons with migraine and insomnia (Aim 1) and to gather exploratory data on the effects of the RELAX intervention on headache and sleep related outcome measures (Aim 2).",YES,Migraine|Headache|Multiple Sclerosis|Insomnia,BEHAVIORAL: Smartphone-Based Progressive Muscle Relaxation Therapy (PMR)|BEHAVIORAL: Monitored Usual Care (MUC),"Number of Patients Enrolled in the Study, Measure of feasibility., Baseline|Daily Diary Satisfaction Scores, 5-item self-assessment measuring satisfaction with the daily dairy function of the RELAXaHEAD app. Items are ranked on a 5-point Likert scale, where: 0 = Strongly Disagree; 1 = Disagree; 2 = Neither Agree nor Disagree; 3 = Agree; and 4 = Strongly Agree.
