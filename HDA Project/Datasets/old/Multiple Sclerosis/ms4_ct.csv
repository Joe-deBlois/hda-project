NCT04754542,Discontinuation of Disease Modifying Therapies (DMTs) in Multiple Sclerosis (MS): Extension of the DISCOMS Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04754542,,COMPLETED,"The Main Hypothesis of this extension trial is that among those who have successfully discontinued their DMT as part of the DISCOMS trial (i.e. did not have a new MS relapse or brain MRI lesion) and remain off DMT after DISCOMS are at no greater risk of new or worsened MS disease activity compared to those who successfully continued their DMT as part of DISCOMS and remain on DMT, each assessed at least one year after termination of the primary DISCOMS study.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,,"Number of Participants Off Drug That Have New Inflammatory Disease Compared to Those on Drug., As inflammatory disease activity may be manifested clinically as a relapse, or radiographically as a new MRI lesion, we have chosen a combined primary outcome measure., Month 36 visit. The Month 36 visit was the extension study's only visit, which occurred 36 months after randomization in the original DISCOMS study (NCT03073603).","Compare the Change in Disability Using the EDSS Over the Duration of the Trial in Those Who Were Able to Maintain Their Treatment Assignment Without Inflammatory Activity., The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a commonly used assessment that allows clinicians to objectively measure changes in a patient's symptoms by using unbiased raters. This assessment will be collected at all time-points and will be used to measure changes in patients' symptoms over the course of the study and will be used to help define 'relapse', i.e. will require a change on examination. Possible scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating a worse outcome (i.e. more severe disability)

NCT03396822,Meningeal Inflammation on 7T MRI as a Tool for Measuring and Predicting Ocrelizumab Response in Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03396822,,COMPLETED,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system. In MS, inflammation is known to attack areas of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves; resulting in disability. Current MRI technology provides an adequate view of the impact of MS on the ""white matter"" of the brain, which contains many of the connections between neurons. Quantification of lesions in the white matter due to MS are a standard part of clinical trials and clinical care in MS. However, it has long been known that MS not only can affect the white matter, but also the ""gray matter,"" which contains the majority of the nerve cells in the brain and can cause inflammation in the meninges (the protective tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord). Autopsy studies have shown that the inflammation seen in the meninges is driven by a B-cells, a subset of white blood cells and that meningeal inflammation may be responsible for damage to the gray matter of the brain.

Ocrelizumab is a new treatment for multiple sclerosis. This medication works by targeting and destroying circulating B-cells. It is thought that this may reduce the level of meningeal inflammation in patients with multiple sclerosis. By reducing meningeal inflammation, this medication may result in less damage to the gray matter and subsequently less disability in MS patients.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the use of a method on 7 tesla (7T) MRI to identify inflammation in the meninges as a potential predictor of response to ocrelizumab treatment for multiple sclerosis. Further, the investigators will evaluate if this MRI technique can be used to monitor the long-term effect of the medication on meningeal inflammation and the development of damage to the gray matter of the brain.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Gadoteridol,"Change in the Number of Enhancing Leptomeningeal Foci on 1 Year Follow up Compared to Baseline in MS Patients Treated With Ocrelizumab., 1 year","Reduction in the Proportion of Participants With Meningeal Enhancement After Treatment With Ocrelizumab Compared to Pre-treatment Baseline., 1 year","Change in the Volume of Contrast Enhancement on Follow up Compared to Baseline., 1 year","University of Maryland, Baltimore","Genentech, Inc.",ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,24,OTHER,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,HP-00074320,2018-09-24,2023-05-25,2023-05-25,2018-01-11,2024-02-05,2024-02-28,"University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, 21201, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/22/NCT03396822/Prot_SAP_001.pdf"

We will use our prospectively collected cohort of patients.

Post-treatment changes in activity (voxel signal) were analyzed based on a statistical threshold, with increased activation defined by a T-value greater than or equal to 2.0 and decreased activation by a T-value less than or equal to 2.0., Baseline (pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 weeks post-OnabotA treatment","Changes in Urodynamic (UDS) Parameters Following OnabotA Treatment, Objective clinical assessments examined changes in urodynamic (UDS) parameters collected during functional MRI (fMRI) sessions at baseline (pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 weeks post-treatment. These included final post-void residual (PVR) volume and maximum cystometric capacity (MCC). MCC was measured during the first bladder infusion cycle of each neuroimaging session and represents the bladder volume at which an individual can no longer delay voiding during bladder filling. An increase in MCC following OnabotA treatment may indicate improved bladder storage capacity, particularly in individuals with reduced bladder compliance or capacity. PVR reflects the volume of urine remaining in the bladder after voiding (measured in CC or mL); higher PVR values suggest less effective bladder emptying., Baseline (Pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 Weeks Post-OnabotA Treatment|Number of Participants Presenting With Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) Events During Urodynamic Studies (UDS) Before and After OnabotA Treatment, This outcome measure assesses the incidence of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) events observed during fMRI/UDS sessions conducted at baseline (pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 weeks following OnabotA treatment. Detrusor overactivity refers to involuntary detrusor muscle contractions observed during the bladder filling phase, which may be spontaneous or provoked. In individuals with neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, these involuntary contractions are attributed to underlying neurologic conditions and are classified as NDO. The presence or absence of NDO events was determined based on detrusor pressure tracings recorded during the bladder filling phase. Participants were categorized as positive for NDO if one or more involuntary contractions were observed. A decrease in the number of participants with NDO events following OnabotA treatment suggests a therapeutic effect on detrusor overactivity and may indicate improved bladder control and reduced urgency or incontinence symptoms., Baseline (Pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 Weeks Post-OnabotA Treatment|Changes in Subjective Clinical Outcomes Following Treatment - Urogenital Distress Inventory, Short Form (UDI-6), The Urinary Distress Inventory, Short Form (UDI-6), is a validated questionnaire used to assess the severity of urinary symptoms and their impact on quality of life. It consists of six items evaluating urinary frequency, urgency-related leakage, stress-related leakage, difficulty emptying the bladder, and discomfort or pain in the lower abdomen or genital area. Each item is scored on a Likert scale (0-4), with higher scores indicating greater symptom-related distress.Total UDI-6 scores are calculated by adding all 6 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 24, where higher scores indicate worse symptoms.

In this study, we report overall UDI-6 total scores (range: 0-24) as well as individual scores (range:0-4) for Questions 1 (urinary frequency) and 2 (urge urinary incontinence) at two timepoints: baseline (pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 weeks following OnabotA treatment., Baseline (Pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 Weeks Post-OnabotA Treatment|Changes in Subjective Clinical Outcomes Following Treatment - Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7), The Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7) is a seven-item questionnaire used to assess the impact of urinary incontinence on a person's quality of life. Each question has the following score range: 0-3 (with the highest score associated with higher symptom distress). Here we report the average overall score, which is calculated by adding scores from all 7 questions. Total score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores reflecting worse symptoms., Baseline (Pre-OnabotA) and 6-10 Weeks Post-OnabotA Treatment|Changes in Voiding Diary Metrics - Urge Urinary Incontinence (UUI) Events Per Day, Voiding diary entries recorded that measure the number of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) events per day.

Participants without a sustained disease progression event were censored on the date of their last assessment or last dose of study drug, whichever was later., From first dose to the end of the 12-month treatment period|Percentage of Participants Who Were Gadolinium Enhancing Lesion-Free at Month 12, MRI scans were analyzed by blinded centralized reading facility., Month 12|Percentage of Participants Who Were T2 Lesion-Free at Month 12, MRI scans were analyzed by blinded centralized reading facility., Month 12|Percent Change From Baseline in Normalized Brain Volume at Month 12, Brain volume (a measure of brain atrophy) was analyzed by MRI., Baseline to Month 12|Change From Baseline to Month 12 in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score Including the Low-Contrast Letter Acuity (LCLA) Test, The MSFC-LCLA is a battery including the following 4 individual scales:

* Timed 25-Foot Walk is an ambulation measure of walking 25 feet with time taken recorded in seconds
* 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function
* Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a measure of executive cognitive function that assesses processing speed, flexibility, and calculation ability
* Low-Contrast Letter Acuity Test (LCLA) used a standardized set of charts to assess low contrast visual acuity, charts are scored according to the number of letters that are identified correctly

Z-scores were calculated for for each component and averaged to create an overall composite score, using the study population as the reference population. A z-score represents the number of standard deviations a patient's test result is higher (z \> 0) or lower (z \< 0) than the average test result (z = 0) of the reference population. A positive change indicates improvement., Baseline to Month 12|Mean Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54 Physical Health Composite Summary and Mental Health Composite Summary Scores, The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related QOL measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items into a single instrument. The instrument includes 12 subscales, two summary scores, and two single-item measures.

The two summary scores - physical health and mental health - are derived from a weighted combination of scale scores.

The physical health composite score includes Physical function, Health perceptions, Energy/fatigue, Role limitations - physical, Pain, Sexual function, Social function, and Health distress.

The mental health composite score includes Health distress, Overall quality of life, Emotional well-being, Role limitations - emotional, and Cognitive function.

Each composite summary score has a range from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline to Month 12|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product (IP). An AE can be any unfavorable or unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP whether or not considered related to the IP. A serious AE (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatient hospitalization. The investigator assessed the severity of AEs as mild, moderate, or severe., From the first dose of study drug until 28 days following the last dose of study drug; mean exposure to study drug was 13.5 months for interferon beta-1a and 13.6 months for each ozanimod group.",,Celgene,,ALL,ADULT,PHASE3,1346,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",RPC01-301|2014-002320-27,2014-12-03,2016-12-22,2016-12-22,2014-11-19,2020-11-25,2020-11-25,"Xenosciences Inc, Phoenix, Arizona, 85004, United States|St Josephs Hospital and Medical Center, Phoenix, Arizona, 85013, United States|Northwest Neuro Specialists PLLC, Tucson, Arizona, 85712, United States|Alta Bates Summit Medical Center, Berkeley, California, 94705, United States|Collaborative Neuroscience Network Inc, Long Beach, California, 90806, United States|University of California Davis Medical Center, Sacramento, California, 95817, United States|Multiple Sclerosis Center at UCSF, San Francisco, California, 94158, United States|Denver Neurological Clinic, Denver, Colorado, 80210, United States|Neurology Associates PA, Maitland, Florida, 32751, United States|Neurology Associates of Ormond Beach, Ormond Beach, Florida, 32174, United States|Infinity Clinical Research LLC, Pompano Beach, Florida, 33060, United States|Neurostudies Inc, Port Charlotte, Florida, 33952, United States|Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, Florida, 34243, United States|Axiom Clinical Research of Florida, Tampa, Florida, 33609, United States|Meridien Research, Tampa, Florida, 33634, United States|West Georgia Sleep Disorder Center and Neurology Associates, Douglasville, Georgia, 30134, United States|Consultants In Neurology, Northbrook, Illinois, 60062, United States|University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, 66160, United States|MidAmerica Neuroscience Research Foundation, Lenexa, Kansas, 66214, United States|Associates In Neurology, Lexington, Kentucky, 40513, United States|Norton Healthcare, Louisville, Kentucky, 40207, United States|Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, 48824, United States|Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology, Golden Valley, Minnesota, 55422, United States|Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89106, United States|Neurology Specialists of Monmouth County PA, West Long Branch, New Jersey, 07764, United States|Neuro Medical Care Associates PLLC, Johnson City, New York, 13790, United States|Raleigh Neurology Associates PA, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27607, United States|Neurology and Neuroscience Associates Inc., Akron, Ohio, 44320, United States|Neurological Research Institute Inc, Columbus, Ohio, 43221, United States|Providence Multiple Sclerosis Center, Portland, Oregon, 97225, United States|University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104, United States|Hope Neurology MS Center, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922, United States|University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Bhupesh Dihenia MD PA, Lubbock, Texas, 79410, United States|EvergreenHealth, Kirkland, Washington, 98034, United States|The Polyclinic, Seattle, Washington, 98104, United States|Neurology of Neurosurgery Associates of Tacoma, Tacoma, Washington, 98405, United States|Center for Neurological Disorders, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, 53215, United States|Grodno Clinical Regional Hospital, Grodno, 230017, Belarus|Minsk Municipal Clinical Hospital 5, Minsk, 220026, Belarus|Republican Scientific and Practical Centre of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Minsk, 220114, Belarus|Minsk City Clinical Hospital 9, Minsk, 220116, Belarus|Vitebsk Regional Diagnostic Centre, Vitebsk, 210023, Belarus|Vitebsk Regional Clinical Hospital, Vitebsk, 210037, Belarus|Clinical Center Banja Luka, Banja Luka, 51000, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Clinical Center University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, 71000, Bosnia and Herzegovina|University Clinical Center Tuzla, Tuzla, 75000, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Military Medical Academy HBAT, Pleven, 5800, Bulgaria|Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment of Neurology and Psychiatry Sv Naum EAD, Sofia, 1113, Bulgaria|Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment National Cardiology Hospital EAD, Sofia, 1309, Bulgaria|Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment Tokuda Hospital Sofia, Sofia, 1407, Bulgaria|University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment Aleksandrovska EAD, Sofia, 1431, Bulgaria|University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment Sveti Ivan Rilski EAD, Sofia, 1431, Bulgaria|University Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment Tsaritsa Yoanna ISUL EAD, Sofia, 1527, Bulgaria|Military Medical Academy -

This assessment is collected at each study visit. Increase in the EDSS score shows disease activity or progression, and must be observed six months later to be confirmed. Whether a confirmed change is significant depends on the subject's EDSS at baseline: for those with a baseline EDSS of 5.5 points or fewer, the increase must be at least one point to be significant; for those with a baseline EDSS of 6.0 points or greater, a change of at least 0.5 points is considered significant.

NCT05878873,The Neural Mechanisms of Split-belt Treadmill Adaptation in People With Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05878873,,COMPLETED,"Majority of people with multiple sclerosis experience difficulty with balance and mobility, leading to an increased risk of falls. The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about brain activity during walking adaptation in people with multiple sclerosis. Also, this clinical trial will test a form of nerve stimulation to see if it can improve walking performance.

The main questions it aims to answer are:

* What areas of the brain are the most active during walking adaptation?
* Can nerve stimulation make walking adaptation more effective?

Participants will walk on a treadmill where each leg will go a different speed which will create walking adaptation. At the same time, brain scans will occur. There will be two sessions of walking adaptation, one with nerve stimulation, and one without nerve stimulation. Researchers will compare people with multiple sclerosis to healthy young adults to see if there are differences in brain activity.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,BEHAVIORAL: Split-belt Treadmill|DEVICE: Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS),"Change in Cortical Activation, Cortical activation is measured using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during split-belt treadmill walking. Hemodynamic responses are modeled using a general linear model (GLM) applied to the oxyhemoglobin (HbO) signal. The model includes regressors for distinct phases of walking, with the primary contrast comparing early adaptation (strides 6-30 after split-belt onset) to a baseline walking period. The outcome is defined as the difference in this HbO beta weight contrast with TENS ON compared to TENS OFF. Activation is averaged across all fNIRS channels to provide a whole-brain estimate of cortical activity. A larger value indicates a greater increase in activation from baseline walking to early adaptation. This was measured on both training session 1 and training session 2 to account for the crossover design (i.e. participants are receiving TENS on different days)., Training session 1 (day 1), training session 2 (day 28)|Change in Adaptation Savings, Adaptation savings is defined as the difference in early adaptation performance between training session 1 (Day 1) and training session 2 (Day 28) during split-belt treadmill walking. Early adaptation is quantified using relative step length asymmetry (SLA), calculated from strides 6 to 30 following split-belt onset. SLA is computed from three-dimensional motion capture and force data as the difference between step lengths of the legs, normalized to total stride length:

SLA = (Step Length\_fast - Step Length\_slow) / (Step Length\_fast + Step Length\_slow).

This yields a unitless measure of asymmetry. The outcome measure is the difference in SLA between visits (training session 2 - training session 1). Larger values reflect faster adaptation at training session 2, consistent with retention of prior learning., Training session 1 (day 1), training session 2 (day 28)|Rate of Step Length Asymmetry Adaptation, Step length asymmetry during early adaptation, representing the rate of adaptation. Early adaptation is quantified using relative step length asymmetry (SLA), calculated from strides 6 to 30 following split-belt onset. SLA is computed from three-dimensional motion capture and force data as the difference between step lengths of the legs, normalized to total stride length:

SLA = (Step Length\_fast - Step Length\_slow) / (Step Length\_fast + Step Length\_slow).

This yields a unitless measure of asymmetry. The outcome measure is the difference in early adaptation SLA during TENS ON compared to TENS OFF. Values closer to zero reflect faster adaptation.This analysis was performed only on data from each participant's first visit to avoid known effects of increased adaptation rate (learning) during subsequent exposures., Training session 1 (day 1)",,,Colorado State University,National Multiple Sclerosis Society,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,51,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,1664,2023-11-28,2024-06-30,2024-06-30,2023-05-26,2025-07-03,2025-07-03,"The Sensorimotor Neuroimaging Laboratory, Fort Collins, Colorado, 80523, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/73/NCT05878873/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/73/NCT05878873/ICF_001.pdf"

The EDSS is evaluated according to signs and symptoms observed during a standard neurological examination. These clinical observations are classified in 7 FS scales, each of them grading signs and symptoms for different neurological functions: pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel or bladder, visual, and cerebral.

Derived using Kaplan-Meier estimates., At 3 and 6 months post first dose.|Number of Participants Free of Gadolinium-Enhanced (GdE) Brain Lesions at Each Visit, Number of participants without gadolinium enhanced (GdE) brain MRI lesions at each visit. Increased numbers of GdE lesions indicates an increase in the in the amount of active inflammation at the site and may be indicative of progressive disease.

Based on cumulative number of GdE lesions at a participant level., At baseline and every 12 months thereafter up until 72 months post first dose.|Number of Participants Free of New or Enlarging T2 Lesions at Each Visit, Number of participants without new or enlarging T2 brain MRI lesions at each visit. Some multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions appear as bright spots in a T2-weighted MRI scan - these are called T2 lesions. The presence of new or larger T2 lesions may mean the participant is at higher risk of disability and may have a less favorable long-term outcome.

Based on cumulative number of new or enlarging T2 lesions at a participant level.

Baseline refers to assessments made on or before the first day participants received study treatment., At baseline and every 12 months thereafter up until 72 months post first dose.|Percent Change in Normalized Brain Volume (Atrophy) on Brain MRI Scans From Baseline at Each Visit, Percent change in normalized brain volume (Atrophy) on brain MRI scans from baseline at each visit. Brain atrophy can be seen in the earliest stages of multiple sclerosis (MS) and is a reliable predictor of future physical and cognitive disability.

Baseline refers to assessments made on or before the first day participants received study treatment., At baseline and every 12 months thereafter up until approximately 87 months post first dose.|Change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score From Baseline at Each Applicable Visit, The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is a 3-part tool to measure disability progression in those with multiple sclerosis (MS). It assesses leg, arm, hand, and cognitive function using 3 individual scales: - The Timed 25-Foot Walk: To measure leg function - The 9-Hole Peg Test: To measure arm and hand function - The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT): To measure cognitive processing speed, flexibility, and calculation ability. Scores from each of the three are converted into Z-scores and averaged to create an overall composite score. The Low-Contrast Letter Acuity Test (LCLA) is performed with the MSFC using a set of charts to assess low contrast visual acuity. Each chart corresponds to a different contrast level, and charts are scored based on the number of letters identified correctly. A Z-score of 0 represents the population mean. Standard deviations above the mean represent a better outcome. Baseline refers to assessments on or before receiving study treatment., At baseline and every 12 months thereafter up until 84 months post first dose.|Change in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 Score From Baseline at Each Applicable Visit, The Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 (MSQOL-54) questionnaire is a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument specific for multiple sclerosis (MS). This 54-item instrument generates 12 subscales along with two summary scores (physical health and mental health - derived from a weighted combination of scale scores), and two additional single-item measures. The subscales are: physical function, role limitations-physical, role limitations-emotional, pain, emotional well-being, energy, health perceptions, social function, cognitive function, health distress, overall quality of life, and sexual function. The MSQOL-54 items are transformed to 0-100 scores, and final scores are obtained by averaging items within the scales. The overall quality of life is assessed in question 54, which is scored on a scale of 0-100. Higher scores indicate better health-related quality of life. Baseline refers to assessments made on or before the first day participants received study treatment., At baseline and every 12 months thereafter up until 84 months post first dose.|Change From Baseline in Volume of Gadolinium Enhanced T1 Lesions, Change from baseline in volume of gadolinium enhanced T1 lesions. T1-lesions are permanently damaged areas of the brain that appear as dark spots or ""black holes"" on a type of MRI scan. The growth of T1 lesions may mean the participant's Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is progressing.

Baseline refers to assessments made on or before the first day participants received study treatment., At baseline and every 12 months thereafter up until 72 months post first dose.|Change From Baseline in Volume of T2 Lesions, Some multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions appear as bright spots in a T2-weighted MRI scan - these are called T2 lesions.

A definite muscle strength value has not been defined. Literally, healthy controls and patients are compared. Higher scores indicate better muscle strength., At baseline (10 minutes before the start of the treatment) and 8 weeks after start of the treatment|Joint Position Sense of the More and Less Affected Knees, Absolute angular errors of the 15°, 45°, and 60° and the mean absolute angular error of the more and less affected knees were measured by an isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Multijoint Pro 3) with active-active angular reproduction method. Estimating the target angel procedure was repeated at 45°, 15°, and 60° and for both the more and less affected legs. After the joint position sense testing, three angles estimated by the patients were averaged, and the angular error was calculated for each target angle. Absolute angular error was calculated by averaging the angular errors, regardless of the numbers being negative or positive. The absolute angular error values of the three target angles were averaged to obtain the mean absolute angular errors. A definite angular error value has not been defined.

NCT03200899,Computer Assisted Cognitive Rehabilitation for Persons With Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03200899,,COMPLETED,"The effects of multiple sclerosis (MS) on cognition, thought to occur in 50-75% of persons with MS, have gained increasing recognition as one of the major disabling symptoms of the disease. While numerous studies have addressed the emotional and physical impact of MS, little attention has been given to strategies that might help manage the cognitive changes commonly experienced by persons with MS. The proposed study will test a novel computer-assisted cognitive rehabilitation intervention, MAPSS-MS (Memory, Attention, \& Problem Solving Skills for Persons with MS). The MAPSS-MS integrates the powerful effects of group interventions to build self-efficacy for new cognitive compensatory strategies/behaviors with individual home-based computer-assisted training. The computer training will assist individuals to develop cognitive skills that they can apply to everyday life using the compensatory strategies learned in the class sessions. In the recently completed exploratory study with 61 persons with MS (R21NR011076), the eight-week MAPSS-MS intervention was acceptable and feasible and had medium to large effects on the use of compensatory strategies and performance on neuropsychological tests of verbal memory. The proposed study will test the refined MAPSS-MS intervention with a larger more diverse sample (N=180) across multiple sites, extend the period of post-intervention follow-up to 6 months and establish whether performance improvements on neuropsychological tests make the important transfer to improved neuro-cognitive functioning in everyday life.

The specific aims of this study are to: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of the novel MAPSS-MS cognitive rehabilitation intervention to improve overall neuro-cognitive competence in activities of daily living including verbal memory performance, use of compensatory cognitive strategies and performance on cognitive-related instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) among persons with MS; (2) Evaluate the efficacy of the MAPSS-MS intervention to improve self-efficacy and related aspects of cognitive performance (non-verbal learning/memory, information processing speed and attention, verbal fluency and complex scanning and tracking) among persons with MS; and (3) Determine the number of intervention participants who achieve and maintain their self-identified cognitive goals three and six months following the intervention. The effects of the intervention on outcome variables will be assessed using a randomized controlled trial design with a comparison group receiving usual care computer games. Measurements of study variables will occur at baseline, immediately after the MAPSS-MS intervention, and three months and six months after the intervention is complete. Statistical analysis will include descriptive statistics and HLM analysis to account for the nested design. The intent-to-treat approach will be used.

Public Health Statement: This research will provide new knowledge about an innovative intervention to improve memory, use of compensatory strategies, and performance of cognitive activities and instrumental activities of daily living for persons with MS.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). People who have MS may have lesions that form on parts of the CNS, such as the brain. Some of these lesions may be inflamed for a long time. This causes MS to progress. There is no treatment for these lesions. Researchers believe that a drug that decreases inflammation can help.

Objective:

To see if a drug called anakinra can help clear inflammation in MS brain lesions.

Eligibility:

People 18 and older with MS and at least one white matter lesion.

Design:

Participants will be screened with one or more Neuroimmunology Clinic protocols.

Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have a lumbar puncture. For this, a needle is inserted between the bones in the back, and cerebrospinal fluid is removed. They will also have an MRI of the brain. The MRI scanner is a cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. Participants will lie on a table that slides in and out of the scanner.

Participants will repeat the above procedures throughout the study.

Participants will get their first dose of anakinra at the clinic. They will administer the rest of the doses themselves, by injection under the skin.

Participants will track their daily dosage electronically or in a written drug diary.

Participants will have 4 visits while taking the drug. At each visit, sharps boxes and empty vials will be collected.

Participants will have 2 follow-up visits after completing treatment.

NCT03853746,Short-term B-cell Depletion in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03853746,,COMPLETED,"Several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) have been shown to be effective in reducing the disease activity in patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) but these treatments, often need to be used continuously for an unknown duration, rendering the long-term use extremely expensive. In addition, chronic administration of DMTs is often associated with undesirable side effects. Among these medications, B-cell depleting monoclonal antibodies might have the properties of an ideal group of medications: i) B-cell depleting antibodies have proven to be extremely potent in reducing or stopping the disease activity in relapsing MS, ii) B-cell depleting antibodies are very safe if used for a short period and use for a short duration may stop the inflammatory disease activity over long term, although current clinical practice and protocols are based on continuing B-cell depletion for an unknown period of time. Indeed, early phase clinical trials of rituximab and ocrelizumab suggested that a short course treatment with B-cell depleting antibodies can have long term effects and disease activity will not return even long after B-cell repopulation in the blood.

This long-term effect might be related to the specific pattern of B-cell tolerance defect in patients with MS and the potential of its normalization with B-cell depleting antibodies. By analyzing the reactivity of recombinant antibodies expressed from single B-cells, the investigators' collaborators have demonstrated that the pattern of B-cell tolerance defect is different in people with MS who only display an impaired removal of developing autoreactive B-cells in the periphery while central B-cell tolerance in the bone marrow is functional in most patients. In contrast, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type-1 diabetes (T1D) or Sjögren's syndrome (SS) show defective central and peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoints. As a consequence, while anti-B-cell therapy does not correct defective early B-cell tolerance checkpoints in T1D and only temporarily slows down autoimmune processes before newly generated autoreactive B-cells likely induce patient relapse, the investigators postulate that the efficacy of B-cell depleting antibodies in MS may be linked to the B-cell depleting antibodies' normal central B-cell tolerance and the production of a normal B-cell and T-cell compartment after anti-B-cell therapy.

The investigators' goal is to provide proof-of-concept that a short duration of treatment with B-cell depleting antibodies can correct B-cell tolerance defects in MS and allow for medication-free prolonged freedom from disease activity, at least in a proportion of subjects with relapsing MS.

In an open label study, 10 patients with active relapsing MS will be treated with two courses of ocrelizumab and will be followed clinically and radiologically for at least two and a half years. Time to the return of disease activity (defined as clinical relapses or new or enhancing lesions on the MRI) will be the primary outcome of the study. The investigators will harvest B-cells before starting the treatment and after B-cell repopulation and assess the central and peripheral tolerance defects. The investigators hypothesize that in most participants, the disease activity will not come back, and this prolonged response to anti cluster of differentiation 20 (CD-20) therapy is associated with normalization of B-cell tolerance defect in these patients. Considering the safety of this approach, it can be adopted widely among people with MS. Hence, the proposed B-cell analyses before and after B-cell depletion in people with MS will provide novel insights regarding the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of B-cell depleting antibodies and the potential long-term suppression of disease activity. This strategy can therefore improve the approach to treatment of many people with relapsing MS.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Ocrelizumab,"Number of Patients With a Return of Disease Activity After the Third Month Post-first-infusion, Number of patients with a return of disease activity after the third month post-first-infusion, objectively demonstrated by development of new T2 hyperintense lesions or Gd-enhancing lesions on the MRI or a clinical relapse that is confirmed with an objective change in the neurological examination., 27 months","Change in Disability as Assessed by Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), EDSS scores range from 0 to 10, with 0.5 steps.

Less time indicates a better performance and more time indicates a worse outcome (min score 60 and max score 300 seconds)., 10-15 minutes|Five Digit Test (FDT). Processing Speed, Processing speed information (which includes reading, count, and alternation speed). Cards with a different number of stimuli are shown to the patient, who has to read, count, and respond to a change of instructions (alternation). Reading speed (min 12, max 31+ seconds), counting speed (min 14, max 28+ seconds), and alternation speed (min 26, max 56+ seconds) are recorded. Less speed corresponds to a better outcome., 8-10 min|Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Is used primarily to assess perseveration and abstract thinking, allows the clinician to assess the following 'frontal' lobe functions: strategic planning, organised searching, utilising environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, directing behaviour toward achieving a goal. WCST measures abstract reasoning and ability to alter problem solving strategies. Patients are given 128 response cards and 4 stimulus cards and asked to match each stimulus card to 1 pile of response cards. The patient is not told how to match the cards, only ""right"" or ""wrong"" to each placement. The examiner may change matching rules during the test. Perseveration errors occur when subject repeats the same error no matter how many times they are told the placement is wrong. Higher scores indicate a worse cognitive performance (min=0-3, max=58-126), 10-15 minutes|Color Trails Test (CTT), Measure sustained attention. The CTT uses numbered coloured circles and universal sign language symbols. The circles are printed with vivid pink or yellow backgrounds that are perceptible to colourblind individuals. For the Colour Trails 1 trial, the respondent uses a pencil to rapidly connect circles numbered 1 through 25 in sequence. Less time indicates better performance (min=10, max= 240)., 5-8 minutes|Tower Of London (TOL). Total Moves and Total Correct Moves, Measures higher order problem-solving ability. The information it provides is not only useful when assessing frontal lobe damage, but also when evaluating attention disorders and executive functioning difficulties. The administrator arranges red, green, and blue beads on a peg board to match the configuration in the diagram. The patient is asked to replicate the configuration on a second peg board. Scores are calculated for Total Correct Moves and Total Moves. Total moves: higher scores indicate a worse cognitive performance (min= 0, max=58+); Total correct higher scores indicate a better cognitive performance (min=0, max=10)., 25-30 minutes|Tower Of London (TOL). Execution Time and Problem-solving Time, Measures higher-order problem-solving ability. The information it provides is not only useful when assessing frontal lobe damage, but also when evaluating attention disorders and executive functioning difficulties.

Scores are calculated for Total Execution Time (since the patient performs the first move until he ends the test), Total Problem-Solving Time (the sum of planning and execution times). Total execution time higher scores indicate a worse outcome (min= 0-78, max=564+ seconds), Total problem-solving time higher scores indicate a worse outcome (min= 0-56, max=500+ seconds)., 25-30 minutes","Improved Physical Capacity, The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time. It is widely used in clinical trials and in the assessment of people with MS. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refers to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refers to the loss of ambulatory ability. It also provides eight subscale measurements called Functional System (FS) scores. The levels of function within each category refer to the eight FS affected by MS: The FS are scored on a scale of 0 (low level of problems) to 5 (high level of problems) to best reflect the level of disability observed clinically., 15-20 minutes|Fatigue, The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) is one of the most frequently used inventories for measuring fatigue in people with chronic illnesses. The FSS questionnaire is comprised of nine statements inquiring about the examinee's sleep habits over the preceding week. Ratings are on a 7-point Likert scale, where higher scores indicate how strongly the patient agrees with the nine statements.Scale. Scoring using a bimodal response system or a Likert score with weights assigned to each response choice. Likert or bimodal rating scales with 4 response options. For the Likert Scale: better than usual= 0, no more than usual= 1, worse than usual= 2, much worse than usual= 3. For the bimodal scale: better than usual= 0, no more than usual= 0, worse than usual= 1, much worse than usual= 1. Sum all items for a total score. Score range. Range is 0 -11 for bimodal response format. Interpretation of scores. Higher score indicates more fatigue. Self report scale, 10 minutes|Walk, Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25-FW). The T25-FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task.

Secondary objectives were:

* To assess the effect of the two doses in comparison to interferon beta-1a on:

  * Frequency of relapses,
  * Fatigue,
  * Participant's satisfaction with treatment.
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the two doses in comparison to interferon beta-1a.

If no events occurred, the participant was considered free of failure.

Each episode of relapse - appearance, or worsening of a clinical symptom that was stable for at least 30 days, that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours in the absence of fever - was to be confirmed by an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale \[EDSS\] score or Functional System scores., Core treatment period between 48 and 118 weeks depending on when the participant was enrolled|Core Treatment Period: Time to Failure: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of the Rate of Failure at Timepoints, Probability of disability progression at 24, 48 and 96 weeks was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method on the time to failure defined as the time from randomization to failure. Participants free of failure were censored at the date of last treatment.

Kaplan-Meier method consists in computing probabilities of non occurrence of event at any observed time of event and multiplying successive probabilities for time ≤t by any earlier computed probabilities to estimate the probability of being event-free for the amount of time t. Probability of event at time t is 1 minus the probability of being event-free for the amount of time t., Core treatment period between 48 and 118 weeks depending on when the participant was enrolled","Core Treatment Period: Annualized Relapse Rate [ARR] - Poisson Regression Estimates, ARR is obtained from the total number of confirmed relapses that occured during the treatment period divided by the sum of the treatment durations.

NCT00735007,12-week Study to Evaluate RebiSmart™ Suitability for Self Injection in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis.,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00735007,,COMPLETED,"The Electronic Device - The RebiSmart™ is an electronic injection device that is being studied for the delivery of Merck Serono's Rebif® New Formulation. The RebiSmart™ device is a stand-alone hand-held device with internal power supply. It is used for subcutaneous (under the skin) injections with single-use sterile disposable needles. The device will be kept in a storage box and placed in the refrigerator after each use.

The key features of the RebiSmart™ are as follows:

* Battery powered electromechanical automatic injector;
* Automatic needle attachment and detachment;
* Hidden needle before and after injection;
* Injection can only be initiated by pressing the injection button when in contact with the skin;
* Automatic needle insertion and injection of the preset dose into the subcutaneous (under the skin) tissue;
* Adjustable injection comfort parameters: Injection depth, needle insertion speed, medication injection speed and time that the needle remains in the skin ;
* Cartridges with 3 doses of Rebif® New Formulation; and
* Several other electronic functions including history (date and time) of cartridge changes and injections.

The Study Drug - Rebif® New Formulation (RNF) Rebif® is a medicine that is part of a family of proteins called interferon beta-1a (IFN-β-1a) molecules that play an important role in the immune system and help limit the damage that occurs with multiple sclerosis (MS). The interferon in Rebif® is like your body's own natural human interferon, but is made outside the body by a process called ""recombinant DNA technology"". Merck Serono International S.A. (the maker of Rebif®) has recently updated the method to make Rebif®, and it is referred to as Rebif® New Formulation (RNF).

For the purpose of this study, the form of Rebif® New Formulation (RNF) will differ slightly from the one you currently receive. RNF will be supplied in pre-filled cartridges containing three doses of 44mcg / 0.5 ml IFN-β-1a. This is the amount required for you to administer during the course of one full week of treatment. The dosage of RNF 44mcg is injected under the skin three times per week. The RebiSmart™ device will be provided for the administration of RNF. RNF should be administered, if possible, at the same time (preferably in the late afternoon or evening) on the same three days (e.g. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), with at least 48 hours break between each administration. You will be asked to record the time and date of each injection in the diary cards provided. You will be taught how to properly use the device to inject the medication. You will also be reminded to rotate injection sites and advised on the importance of avoiding already inflamed areas for future injections.

The goals of this research trial are:

* To evaluate if the electronic device can be used (if it is suitable) by MS patients performing self-injections of Rebif® New Formulation.
* To determine MS patients overall satisfaction of the new RebiSmart™ device by determining their ease in using it, how often side effects happen (flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions and any other overall injection issues) that they may experience while on the trial. This will be done by completion of the Patient User Trial Questionnaire and the Multiple Sclerosis Treatment Concern Questionnaire (MSTCQ).
* To evaluate specific features of the RebiSmart™ device from the answers MS patients provide in the User Trial Questionnaire. The MS patient and the person who will trains them on the proper use of the device will complete this questionnaire.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Rebif® New Formulation (RNF) using RebiSmartTM,"The Number of Subjects Rating the Suitability of RebiSmart at the End of 12-week Treatment Period for Self-injecting Rebif® New Formulation (RNF)., RebiSmart was evaluated as ""very suitable or suitable""; ""a little suitable""; or ""not suitable at all"" for self-injecting RNF.

NCT00591721,Teleconference Fatigue Management for People With Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00591721,,COMPLETED,"Approximately 60% of individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) describe fatigue as their most disabling symptom. Energy conservation education involves teaching people with MS different strategies to manage fatigue and reduce its impact on daily life. Despite growing evidence of the effectiveness of face-to-face energy conservation education, not all people with MS are able to access these programs. The purpose of this project is to test the effectiveness and efficacy of a teleconference-delivered energy conservation education program for people with MS. The primary goals of the project are to reduce the impact of fatigue on participants' everyday lives, reduce fatigue severity, and improve quality of life. Secondary goals are to increase self-efficacy for managing fatigue and increase the number of energy conservation strategies used. The study will employ a randomly allocated two group time series design with a wait-list control group, which is one type of randomized control trial. A total of 181 people with MS will be recruited through direct mailing and advertising. The program will be delivered by telephone teleconference by a licensed occupational therapist. Outcome measures will be administered over the telephone by a research assistant before and after the program, at three months and at six months. We hypothesize that: (1) individuals in the immediate intervention group achieve better outcomes than individuals in the wait-list control group; (2) the program leads to significant reductions in fatigue impact and fatigue severity, and improved quality of life; and (3) improvements in the outcomes can be maintained over six months.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,BEHAVIORAL: Energy conservation education,"Change From Baseline in Subscale Scores of the Fatigue Impact Scale, Fatigue impact was measured using the ""Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS)"" (Fisk et al, 1994).

NCT00273364,Stem Cell Therapy for Patients With Multiple Sclerosis Failing Alternate Approved Therapy- A Randomized Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00273364,,COMPLETED,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is at onset an immune-mediated demyelinating disease. In most cases, it starts as a relapsing-remitting disease with distinct attacks and no symptoms between flares. Over years or decades, virtually all cases transition into a progressive disease in which insidious and slow neurologic deterioration occurs with or without acute flares. Relapsing-remitting disease is often responsive to immune suppressive or modulating therapies, while immune based therapies are generally ineffective in patients with a progressive clinical course. This clinical course and response to immune suppression, as well as neuropathology and neuroimaging studies, suggest that disease progression is associated with axonal atrophy. Disability correlates better with measures of axonal atrophy than immune mediated demyelination. Therefore, immune based therapies, in order to be effective, need to be started early in the disease course while MS is predominately an immune-mediated and inflammatory disease. While current immune based therapies delay disability, no intervention has been proven to prevent progressive disability. We propose, as a randomized study, autologous unmanipulated PBSCT using a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG) versus FDA approved standard of care (i.e. interferon, glatiramer acetate, mitoxantrone, natalizumab, fingolimod, or tecfidera) in patients with inflammatory (relapsing) MS despite treatment with alternate approved therapy.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,PROCEDURE: Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy|DRUG: Standard treatment with a conventional drug,"Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Improvement, The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 increments that represent higher levels of disability.

NCT02499900,Study to Assess Medication Satisfaction in Patients With Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Copaxone®,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02499900,CONFIDENCE,COMPLETED,The primary objective of this study is to compare patient medication satisfaction as measured by the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) scores between the Copaxone 40 mg/mL three time a week (TIW) group and the Copaxone 20 mg/mL once daily (QD) group over 6 months of treatment.,YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Copaxone®,"Change From Baseline in the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, Patient satisfaction with the study medication was assessed using the MSQ a 1-item global patient-rated scale. Patients were asked to respond on a 7-point scale, ranging from extremely dissatisfied (1) to extremely satisfied (7), to the following: ""Overall, how satisfied are you with your current medication?"". Positive change from baseline score indicates greater satisfaction with the medication. Estimates and p-value are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA model with visit as a repeated effect: MSQ=baseline MSQ score+treatment+visit+treatment by visit interaction., Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6","Change From Baseline in the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 9-item Version (TSQM-9) Convenience Score to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, Convenience perception was measured by the 3 convenience items (items 4 to 6) within the validated TSQM-9. The responses to each of the 3 convenience items are reported on a 1-to-7 scale. The TSQM-9 convenience scale is computed, for each subject, by adding the 3 items loading on each response with the lowest possible total score (1\*3 on the 3 items) subtracted from this composite score, and divided by the greatest possible score (3\*7) minus the lowest possible score (3), i.e., 21-3=18. This provides a transformed score between 0 and 1 that was multiplied by 100. The final scale is 0 (Extremely Difficult/Inconvenient) to 100 (Extremely Easy/Convenient). If more than one item is missing, then the convenience scale was considered invalid for that patient. Estimates and p-value are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA with treatment, visit, and Country/Geographical Region as main factors, visit by treatment as the interaction term, and baseline score as the covariate., Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Change From Baseline in the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) Total Score and Subscales to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, MFIS is a modified form of the Fatigue Impact Scale based on items derived from interviews with MS patients concerning how fatigue impacts their lives. It is a structured, self-report questionnaire consisting of 21 items assessing the effects of fatigue. All 21 items are scaled 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a greater impact of fatigue on patient's activities. The Total MFIS score ranges from 0 to 84, the Physical Subscale from 0 to 36, the Cognitive Subscale from 0 to 40, and the Psychosocial Subscale from 0 to 8. A score of 0 indicates fatigue has no impact on activities and the high-end score indicates fatigue has extreme impact on activities. Negative change from baseline values indicate improvement in the effects of fatigue. Estimates and p-values are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA model with visit as a repeated effect: change from, Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Change From Baseline in the Mental Health Index (MHI) Total Score and Subscales to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, The MHI consists of 18 items and provides an assessment of 4 subscales of mental health, including Anxiety (5 items), Depression (4 items), Behavioral control (4 items), and Positive Affect (4 items), and 1 Total Score. The subscales and Total Score for analyses range from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating not mentally healthy and 100 indicating superior mental health. Positive change from baseline scores indicate improved mental health. Estimates and p-values are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA model with visit as a repeated effect: change from baseline MHI score=baseline MHI Total Score +treatment +visit +country/geographic region +treatment by visit interaction. If a participant skipped x items of y items, the scale was not computed: - MHI Total Score - 9 of 19 - Anxiety subscale - 2 of 5 - Depression subscale - 2 of 4 - Behavioral Control subscale - 2 of 4 - MHI Positive Affect subscale - 2 of 4, Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Change From Baseline in the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) Total Score to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, Depressive symptoms were measured by the BDI-II, a 21-item, self-reported rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. The BDI-II assesses mood, pessimism, sense of failure, self-dissatisfaction, guilt, punishment, self-dislike, self-accusation, suicidal ideas, sadness, crying, irritability, social withdrawal, body image, work difficulties, insomnia, fatigue, appetite, weight loss, bodily preoccupation, and loss of libido. Each of the 21 items is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. BDI-II Total Score indicates the severity of depression and has a total range of 0 to 63. For those clinically diagnosed, scores from 0-13 represent minimal depressive symptoms, scores of 14-19 indicate mild depression, scores of 20-28 indicate moderate depression, and scores of 30-63 indicate severe depression. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement., Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During Both the Core Period and Extension Periods, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any study-related event that represents a change (positive or negative) in frequency or severity from a baseline (prestudy) event (if any), regardless of the presence of causal relationship or medical significance. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any adverse event with a start date on or after the first study dose date. The investigator determined relation to study drug. A severe AE is defined as an inability to carry out usual activities. A serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Although a subject may have had 2 or more adverse experiences the subject is counted only once in a category.

BMVT-R form consists of six figures. Points are awarded based on the accuracy of the drawn figure and by correct placement on the blank page. A minimum of 0 to 12 points/scores are awarded per trial, so a participant can score between 0 and 36 points for all three trials (by adding the points/score from each trial), where higher score indicates better outcome., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Trail Making Test- Part A (TMT-A) Test Scores (in Seconds) at Week 96 and 192, 'Trail Making Test Part A' is a neuropsychological test of visual attention and task switching. The task requires a participant to 'connect-the-dots' of 25 consecutive numbers (1,2, 3, etc.) in sequential order on a sheet of paper or computer screen. The goal of the participant is to finish the test as quickly as possible, and the time taken to complete the test used as the primary performance metric (in seconds). This is a timed test and the number of seconds to complete the task is recorded. Maximum time allowed is 300 seconds. A lower score indicated better cognitive function., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Trail Making Test B (TMT-B) Test Scores (in Seconds) at Weeks 96 and 192, TMT-B is a cognitive test that gives a measure of various aspects of cognitive performance. It is used to measure cognitive fatigue. The test consisted of 25 circles containing 13 sequential numbers (1 to 13) and 12 sequential letters (A to L) positioned. The test evaluates the time (in seconds) to correctly order letters and numbers in alternate order (1, A, 2, B etc.). Maximum time allowed is 300 seconds, where less time/lower score indicated better cognitive function/performance., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Beery Visual-motor Integration (BVMI) Scores at Weeks 96 and 192, The Beery VMI is a non-verbal assessment that assessed the extent to which individuals can integrate their visual and motor abilities. The participants were provided with geometric designs ranging from simple line drawings to more complex figures and were asked to copy the designs. The test consisted of 24 figures. One point was scored for each successful copy of drawings and no scoring was given when the participant failed to copy the drawings properly. Each successful copying of drawings was summed up and the total was scored on a scale ranged from 0 to 24, where higher score indicated better visual construction skills/better visual and motor abilities and lower score indicated poor visual construction skills/poor visual and motor abilities., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-II (WASI-II) Vocabulary Total Raw Scores at Weeks 96 and 192, The WASI-II: Vocabulary test is a quick estimate of an individual's level of intellectual functioning which comprised of 31 total items that required the participant to orally define 3 images and 28 words presented both orally and visually. Items 1 to 3 rated on a score of 0 or 1, items 4 and 5 rated on a score of 0 or 2, items 6 to 31 rated on a scale of 0 to 2. Each item score was summed up to derive the total score which ranged from 0 (minimum score) to 59 (maximum score), where higher score indicated better level of intellectual functioning/higher level of intelligence., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System (D-KEFS) Letter Fluency Total Correct Raw Score at Weeks 96 and 192, Letter Fluency is a condition measured in the D-KEFS. Participants were asked to name as many words as they can, starting with a specified letter for 60 seconds. The words cannot be names, places, numbers or grammatical variants of previous answers. Repeated answers were not scored as a correct response. There were 3 trials, with 3 different letters. The total number of correct responses was totaled for all 3 trials and a letter fluency score was given. A higher score was considered better. There was no set range as the score depends on how many correct words the participant relays in the given time period., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|Cognitive Assessment: Change From Baseline in Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System Category Fluency Total Correct Raw Score at Weeks 96 and 192, Category Fluency is a condition measured in the D-KEFS. It measured participant's ability to generate words from three different categories (e.g., fruits, vegetables and animals), within a minute for each category. Total score was number of correct words for each category with no points for repetitions or non-words. Score ranged from 0 to unlimited, where 0 = low score, higher score indicated better performance., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|Cognitive Assessment - Selective Reminding Test (SRT): Change From Baseline in Total Number of Words on Delayed Recall at Weeks 96 and 192, SRT is a test to assess verbal learning and memory. During the administration of the SRT only the examiner and the participant should be in the testing room. A list of twelve words was read aloud by the examiner at a rate of one word per two seconds. The participant is asked to recall all twelve words after a 30 minute delay. Only the words that were missed on the preceding trial were given in the consecutive trial. The total score represented a sum score of total 6 trials, therefore the score range was from 0 to 72. The lower the score the worse the outcome, higher score indicated better recall., Baseline, Weeks 96 and 192|DB: Pharmacokinetics: Steady-state Trough Concentration (Ctrough) of Teriflunomide, Ctrough was defined as the concentration reached by the drug before the next dose administered.

NCT04942938,Impact of Direct Current Electrical Stimulation on Spasticity Levels and Functional Muscle Use in MS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04942938,,COMPLETED,"In an individual with MS the central nervous system (CNS) is over-protective and causes the threshold for stretch reflex and muscle tightness to be set lower than normal. This inhibits normal movement and causes abnormalities in posture, stiffness and at times joint contractures. In this pilot study we hope to assess the ability for the direct current of Neubie, which creates mechanoreceptor inputs and lengthening at the sarcomere level of muscle and joints in the spine and lower extremity, to alter the proprioceptive peripheral nervous system (PNS) at muscle spindle and GTO level with a change in CNS over-guarding during the treatment and after the treatment. If the investigators are able to create normalized stretch and muscle tension at the PNS level, it may be possible to create temporary or sustained CNS level changes. This would allow the amount of stretch and tension at the PNS level to be normalized and possibly reduce spasticity. If this theory is accurate, the investigators may be able to increase access to normalized movement, strength and functional ability in individuals with neuro-compromise.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DEVICE: Neubie,"Expanded Disability Status Score, The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis and monitoring changes in the level of disability over time.

NCT04391023,Cerebellar tDCS and Balance Training in PwMS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04391023,,COMPLETED,"Many people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) have decreased balance and postural control, gait deficits, and a high frequency of falls. High fall rates and mobility impairments pose a significant risk to the independence and quality of life of PwMS. Therefore, effective interventions to improve balance and postural control are urgently needed to decrease the frequency of falls in PwMS. Balance training has been demonstrated to significantly improve postural control and gait in PwMS. One possible treatment modality to amplify the effects of balance training is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive means to increase cortical excitability and potentially prime the brain for task specific learning. The cerebellum plays a vital role in balance and posture and may be an important target structure for tDCS studies seeking to reduce fall risk. Studies have shown that anodal cerebellar tDCS is effective in improving balance control in older adults with high fall risk and patients with chronic stroke. However, the most effective tDCS intensity and the duration of the effects on balance control has not been established. Moreover, no study has combined cerebellar tDCS and balance training to reduce fall risk in PwMS. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on fall risk in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. We will conduct tDCS or SHAM followed by balance training on 4 consecutive days. We will evaluate fall risk with well-established functional tasks, such as the Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go (TUG), the six minute walk test (6MWT), and static posturography.

Prospective participants, men and women with relapsing-remitting MS, will be recruited. To accomplish this study, 30 participants will be randomly assigned into 3 groups (2 mA tDCS, 4 mA tDCS, or SHAM). This study involves 4 daily visits at the Integrative Neurophysiology Lab at the same time of day for each subject and three follow-up visits. The duration of visit 1 will be approximately 2.5 hours and the duration of visits 2-4 will be approximately 1.5 hours. Visit 5, 6, and 7 will be approximately 24 hours, 1 week, and 3 weeks, respectively, after visit 4 and will last approximately 1.5 hours. During tDCS sessions, participants will undergo either Sham, 2 mA, and 4 mA tDCS for 20 minutes followed by balance training.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DEVICE: Sham Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS)|BEHAVIORAL: Balance Training|DEVICE: 2 mA Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation|DEVICE: 4 mA Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation,"Score on the Berg Balance Scale, The BBS is a valid and reliable assessment of balance during static (e.g., standing with eyes closed) and dynamic conditions (e.g., completing a 360-degree turn) conditions. BBS scores range from 0 to 56. Lower scores indicate increased impairment in balance. A cut-off score of 44 has been established as a criterion to identify PwMS with a high fall risk., 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-intervention|Time to Complete the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), The TUG measures the time it takes for the participant to rise from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. Two trials were completed and the reported score is the average time between the two trials. A higher number means it took the participant more time to complete the task (i.e., worse performance)., 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-intervention","Time to Complete the Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), Subjects performed the 6MWT in a cordoned-off hallway with two symbols on the ground, placed 30 meters apart. Subjects were instructed to walk as far as possible between the marks for 6 minutes, walking around each symbol like a cone. Higher scores indicate more distance walked (i.e., better performance)., 24 hours, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks post-intervention|Score on the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), The FSS consists of nine statements used to assess perceived fatigability. Subjects are asked to rate how much they felt a statement applied to them, on a 7-point scale (low value = does not apply, high value = high agreement with the statement). The questionnaire is scored by calculating the average response to the statements. Therefore, the scores will range from 1 to 7 (1 = low fatigue, 7 = high fatigue).

If a clear treatment effect is sustained in the R-GA arm, defined as a ≥ 70% decrease in brain lesions on MRI, using a CUL approach, attributable to MS and ≥ 70% reduction in annual relapse rates, compared to the GA arm, the study will continue under the extension protocol. If induction therapy fails to show superiority, at any point, the study will be stopped., Baseline through 24 months","Time to Treatment Failure, Time itself is the outcome. Whenever treatment failure occurs for the first time within the follow up period of 24 months (2 years)., Baseline through 24 months|Number of Subjects That Fail Treatment, Baseline through 24 months|Number of Relapse-free Subjects, Change in neurological symptoms in association with EDSS change is defined as relapse., Baseline through 24 months|Number of Patients Treated for Relapse With Corticosteroid, Baseline through 24 months|Number of Subjects Who Experience Multiple Relapses, Baseline through 24 months|Number of Patients That Develop Sustained Accumulation of Disability, Sustained accumulation of disability is defined as a 1 point change or more on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS); sustained for at least three months. Physicians assess patients' cerebral, optic, brainstem, pyramidal, sensory, cerebellar, and bowel and bladder neurological symptoms. The physician then subjectively rates the patient on the ordinal EDSS scale. The EDSS scale emphasizes ambulatory ability. The EDSS scale ranges in half integer increments from 0.0 to 10.0. Larger numbers mean more disability, with 0.0 being everything normal and 10.0 being death due to MS., Baseline through 24 months|Change From Baseline to 24 Months on the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Z-score, The MSFC consists of Timed 25 Foot Walk Tests, 9 Hole Peg Tests, and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), administered by clinicians. The subscales are then converted into Z-scores and averaged to create the MSFC Z-score. Larger values denote improvements., Observations were recorded at baseline and 24 months.|Percentage of Subjects Worsening One Point or More on the Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) Questionnaire, For PDDS the patient selects an integer 0-8 according to their personal assessment of their degree of ambulatory disability. Larger numbers mean more disability, with 0 being no disability and 8 being bedridden. There is an unclassifiable category as well., Baseline through 24 months|Change in Mean Score on Performance Scales (Baseline to 24 Months), Performance scales measures patient assessments of disability in mobility (1-6), hand (1-5), vision (1-5), fatigue (1-5), cognitive (1-5), bladder and bowel, sensory (1-5), and spasticity (1-5). The overall measure of performance is the sum of subscales, ranging from 0 to 41.

One cognitive domain that has been shown to impact daily functioning, but is understudied in MS, is prospective memory (PM). While there have been successful PM interventions in other clinical populations, to date there has not been a specific PM intervention for PwMS that has been tested in a clinical trial.

The study will be a double-masked randomized feasibility trial, with 18 participants randomized to a PM intervention and 18 participants randomized to an active control (psychoeducation). Participants will meet with an interventionist twice a week for four weeks. Feasibility will be assessed via 1) recruitment, enrollment, and retention; 2) adherence to the treatment; 3) treatment credibility and expectancy; and 4) treatment satisfaction. A preliminary effect size (Cohen's d) will be computed for the group difference using participants' performance on the Memory for Intentions Test, which will be given at baseline (week 1) and post-treatment (week 6).

Participants who successfully completed the initial study were offered to continue their treatment (same compound, same dose) for 24 additional weeks.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Teriflunomide|DRUG: Placebo (for teriflunomide)|DRUG: Interferon-β [IFN-β]|DRUG: Glatiramer Acetate [GA],"Overview of Adverse Events [AE], AE are any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, syndrome, or illness observed by the investigator or reported by the participant during the study., from first study drug intake in PDY6045/PDY6046 study up to 112 days after last intake in initial study or in the extension study, whichever occured last (64 weeks max)|Overview of AE With Potential Risk of Occurence, AE with potential risk of occurrence were defined as follows:

* Hepatic disorders;
* Immune effects, mainly effects on bone marrow and infection;
* Pancreatic disorders;
* Malignancy;
* Skin disorders, mainly hair loss and hair thinning;
* Pulmonary disorders;
* Hypertension;
* Peripheral neuropathy;
* Psychiatric disorders;
* Hypersensitivity., from first study drug intake in PDY6045/PDY6046 study up to 112 days after last intake in initial study or in the extension study, whichever occured last (64 weeks max)|Liver Function: Number of Participants With Potentially Clinically Significant Abnormalities [PCSA], PCSA values are abnormal values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined criteria based on literature review.

Hepatic parameters thresholds were defined as follows:

* Alanine Aminotransferase \[ALT\] \>3, 5, 10 or 20 Upper Normal Limit \[ULN\];
* Aspartate aminotransferase \[AST\] \>3, 5, 10 or 20 ULN;
* Alkaline Phosphatase \>1.5 ULN;
* Total Bilirubin \[TB\] \>1.5 or 2 ULN;
* ALT \>3 ULN and TB \>2 ULN;, from first study drug intake in PDY6045/PDY6046 study up to 112 days after last intake in initial study or in the extension study, whichever occured last (64 weeks max)","Annualized Relapse Rate [ARR]: Poisson Regression Estimates, ARR is obtained from the total number of confirmed relapses that occured during the treatment period divided by the sum of the treatment durations.

Each episode of relapse - appearance, or worsening of a clinical symptom that was stable for at least 30 days, that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours in the absence of fever - was to be confirmed by an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale \[EDSS\] score or Functional System scores.

To account for the different treatment durations among participants, two Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used (total number of confirmed relapses as response variable, log-transformed treatment duration as ""offset"" variable and:

* Model 1 (IFN-β groups): treatment group, region of enrollment and IFN-β dose level as covariates
* Model 2 (GA groups): treatment group and region of enrollment as covariates), 48 weeks|Overview of 12-week Sustained Disability Progression, 12-week sustained disability progression was defined as an increase from baseline of at least 1-point in EDSS score (at least 0.5-point for participants with baseline EDSS score \>5.5) that persisted for at least 12 weeks.

If no disability progression was observed on or before last EDSS evaluation before study drug discontinuation, then the participant was considered as free of disability progression., 48 weeks|Time to 12-week Sustained Disability Progression: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of the Rate of Disability Progression at Timepoints, Probability of disability progression at 24 and 48 weeks was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method on the time to disability progression defined as the time from randomization to first EDSS increase. Participants free of disability progression were censored at the date of the last on-treatment EDSS evaluation.

Kaplan-Meier method consists in computing probabilities of non occurrence of event at any observed time of event and multiplying successive probabilities for time ≤t by any earlier computed probabilities to estimate the probability of being event-free for the amount of time t. Probability of event at time t is 1 minus the probability of being event-free for the amount of time t., 48 weeks|Cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI] Assessment: Change From Baseline in Total Lesion Volume (Burden of Disease), Total lesion volume is the sum of the total volume of all T2-lesions and the total volume all T1-hypointense post-gadolinium lesions measured through T2/proton density scan analysis and gadolinium-enhanced T1 scan analysis.

Least-square means were estimated using two Mixed-effect models with repeated measures \[MMRM\] on cubic root transformed volume data:

* Model 1 (IFN-β groups): treatment group, region of enrollment, IFN-β dose level, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline value (cubic root transformed), and baseline-by-visit interaction as factors;
* Model 2 (GA groups): treatment group, region of enrollment, visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, baseline value (cubic root transformed), and baseline-by-visit interaction as factors., baseline (before randomization in PDY6045 or PDY6046) and 48 weeks|Cerebral MRI Assessment: Number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions Per Scan (Poisson Regression Estimates), Number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions per scan is obtained from the total number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions observed during the study divided by the total number of scans performed during the study.

To account for the different number of scans among participants, two Poisson regression models with robust error variance were used (total number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions as response variable, log-transformed number of scans as ""offset"" variable and:

* Model 1 (IFN-β groups): Treatment group, region of enrollment, IFN-β dose level and baseline number of Gd-enhancing T1-lesions as covariates

To quantify absolute CMRO2, both TRUST MRI for quantification of venous oxygenation (Yv) and phase contrast (PC) MRI for quantification of total blows are needed. The total scan time for CMRO2 MRI is approximately 4 minutes., Day 1 (Visit 1 - approximately 4 minutes)|Intra-Individual Variability (IIV) as Measured by Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB), The core Cogstate Reaction Time (RT) tasks involve a deck of cards on a green background screen and the participant answers ""yes"" or ""no"" by hitting a keyboard key (""D"" or ""K"") across repeated trials. Each task first includes instructions and practice period before the test begins and takes approximately 3-4 minutes to complete (for a total of \~7 minutes). The representative timed RT scores are provided by the Detection task (indicating when a card is revealed; DET/simple RT), Identification task (""is the card revealed black or red?""; IDN/choice RT), and One-Back (""Is this the card that you just saw?""). Performance is characterized by near complete accuracy (i.e. all, or almost all, items are answered correctly), and validity checks are built into the scoring. IIV is calculated as intraindividual standardized deviations (ISD) in RTs across both tasks, measured in milliseconds and with log10 transformation., Day 1 (Visit 1)","Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) Z-Score, SDMT is 90-second cognitive task in which the participant is shown a sheet containing rows of symbols. Each symbol corresponds to a specific number. The participant's task is to say out loud the number associated with each symbol. SDMT is used as a general cognitive screen to detect severe cognitive impairment. The raw score is the correct number of substitutions in 90 seconds, scores range between 0 and 110. The lower the score, the more severe the cognitive impairment. The raw score is converted to a Z-score with a central value of 0. Standard deviations below the mean indicate a worse outcome; a Z-score of -1.5 or lower suggests a significant deviation from the average performance, potentially indicating cognitive impairment., Day 1 (Visit 1)|BICAMS Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) Z-Score, RAVLT is a well-recognized measure of a person's ability to encode, combine, store and recover verbal information in different stages of immediate memory. consists of presenting a list of 15 words across consecutive trials. The list is read aloud to the participant, and then the participant is immediately asked to recall as many words as one remembers. This procedure is repeated for 5 consecutive trials (Trials 1 to 5). The total score is the sum of trials 1-5 and ranges from 0-75. The lower the score, the more severe the cognitive impairment. The raw score is converted to a Z-score with a central value of 0. Standard deviations below the mean indicate a worse outcome; a Z-score of -1.5 or lower indicates impairment, meaning the individual's performance is significantly below the average of their peer group., Day 1 (Visit 1)|BICAMS Brief Visuospatial Memory Test Revised (BVMT-R) Z-Score, Visual/spatial memory is assessed in BICAMS using the BVMT-R. In this test, six abstract designs are presented for 10 sec. The display is removed from view and patients render the stimuli via pencil on paper manual responses. Each design receives from 0 to 2 points representing accuracy and location. There are three Learning Trials, and the score is reported as the total number of points earned over the trials. Thus, scores range from 0 to 12 per trial; total score range is 0 to 36 for all three trials. The lower the score, the more severe the cognitive impairment. The raw score is converted to a Z-score with a central value of 0. Standard deviations below the mean indicate a worse outcome; a Z-score of -1.5 or lower on the BVMT-R is generally considered indicative of cognitive impairment., Day 1 (Visit 1)",,NYU Langone Health,National Multiple Sclerosis Society,ALL,ADULT,NA,60,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NON_RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: SCREENING,21-01385,2022-02-09,2024-06-20,2024-06-20,2022-09-16,2025-07-14,2025-07-14,"NYU Langone Health, New York, New York, 10016, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/15/NCT05543915/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"

A diffusion tensor was fitted to each voxel of the brain, and a fractional anisotropy (FA) map was created for each subject. The images were further analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS).

Fractional anisotropy (FA) is a scalar value between zero and one that describes the degree of anisotropy of a diffusion process. A value of zero means that diffusion is isotropic, i.e. it is unrestricted (or equally restricted) in all directions. A value of one means that diffusion occurs only along one axis and is fully restricted along all other directions. FA is a measure often used in diffusion imaging where it is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in white matter. The FA is an extension of the concept of eccentricity of conic sections in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range., 2 months","Berg Balance Scale, BBS, 14 items objective measure of static balance and risk of falls (0 the best, 56 the worse), 2 months|Timed up and go Test, TUG, time necessary to stand up, go 3 meters, turn around, go back and sit to chair (longer time in seconds is worse function), 2 months|the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale, MSWS - 12, The Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale is a self-assessment scale which measures the impact of MS on walking.

NCT03468868,Comparative Effectiveness Study Telerehab Versus Conventional,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03468868,,COMPLETED,"This study aims to compare the effectiveness of an exercise program delivered in a conventional facility-based format versus a telerehabilitation format, which takes place in the home. Exercise can improve mobility and perhaps decrease the rate and extent of disability in people with MS. Evidence shows that traditional, facility-based exercise training may help people with MS consistently participate in exercise or to exercise at a higher, more intense level. Despite this evidence, lack of access to facility-based exercise programs may make it difficult for people with MS to engage in exercise.Telerehabilitation (telerehab) has great potential to overcome challenges associated with facility-based programs. Telerehab can include videoconferencing, remote monitoring of signs and activity, and dissemination of specialized and individualized information via electronic mechanisms, such as smartphones and computers. Both facility-based and telerehab exercise training have yielded positive results in people with MS, but have not been compared head-to-head. The current study will fill this gap in the evidence base and compare the outcomes of delivering the same exercise interventions in a facility or in the home/community using a telerehab approach. The interventions are designed to be identical in content, with the only difference being the mode of training delivery.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis,BEHAVIORAL: Exercise program for people with MS,"Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25FWT), The Timed 25 Foot Walk Test (T25FWT) is a measure of walking speed. Individuals are instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly and safely as possible from one marked end to the other.

Higher walking speed (feet per second) indicate improved walking function., Change from baseline T25FWT at 16-weeks","Six Minute Walk Test (6MWT), The six minute walk test (6MWT) assesses walking endurance and aerobic capacity. The score is the distance walked in 6 minutes. Higher scores (more distance walked in feet) indicate improved walking capacity., Change from baseline at 16 weeks|Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS)-12 Questionnaire, The MSWS-12 is a self-reported measure of the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) on walking ability and daily activities over the past two weeks. Items are scored from 1-5, with 1 meaning no limitation and 5 meaning extreme limitation.

Scores are calculated by first adding the responses, and getting a total score of 12 - 60. This score is then transformed to a 0 - 100 scale (Nilsagard et al, 2007) by subtracting 12 from the sum, dividing by 48, and then multiplying by 100.

Higher scores indicate a greater impact of MS on walking than lower scores., Change from baseline at 16 weeks|Godin Leisure-Time Physical Activity (LTPA) Questionnaire, The Godin LTPA is a 4-item, self-administered questionnaire assessing leisure-time physical activity. 3 questions ask how many times the individual participated in mild/light (e.g. yoga, easy walking), moderate (e.g. tennis, fast walking), and/or strenuous (e.g. running, basketball) activities in the past 7 days. The 4th question asks how often in a typical 7-day period the individual participates in an activity long enough to break a sweat (often, sometimes, or never/rarely).

More strenuous activities are more heavily weighted. Total leisure activity score is calculated by multiplying the number of strenuous activities by 9, the number of moderate activities by 5, and the number of mild activities by 3, and then adding those scores together.

A higher score means that the individual participates in more and/or more vigorous leisure-time physical activity. 24 units or more = active; 14-23 units = moderately active; \< 14 units = sedentary., Change from baseline at 16 weeks|Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QOL) Survey, Domains (anxiety, depression, fatigue, upper extremity function, lower extremity function, cognitive function, emotional and behavioral dyscontrol, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, satisfaction with social roles and activities, stigma) - possible score of 8-40. Positive affect domain has possible score of 9-45. Communication domain has possible score of 5-25. No clinical thresholds established. Higher scores indicate WORSE self-reported health for Anxiety, Depression, Fatigue, Emotional and Behavioral Dyscontrol, Sleep Disturbance, Stigma. Higher scores indicate BETTER self-reported health for Upper Extremity Function, Lower Extremity Function, Cognitive Function, Positive Affect \& Well-Being, Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities, Satisfaction with Social Roles \& Activities, Communication., Change from baseline at 16 weeks.|Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS)-29, The MSIS measures individual's views on the impact of MS on day-to-day life during the past two weeks. It is comprised of two subscales: a 20-item physical impact scale and a 9-item psychological impact scale. The MSIS has no combined total score. Scores on the physical impact scale can range from 20 to 80 and on the psychological impact scale from 9 to 36.

Lower scores indicate little impact of MS, and higher scores indicate a higher impact of MS (on either physical or psychological functioning)., Change from baseline at 16 weeks.|Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), The MFIS is a 21-item questionnaire that measures the impact of fatigue on the participant's activities and lifestyle over the past four weeks. Items on the MFIS can be broken into three subscales (physical, cognitive, and psychosocial), as well as into a total MFIS score. The physical subscale score can range from 0 to 36. The cognitive subscale score can range from 0 to 40. The psychosocial subscale score can range from 0 to 8. The total MFIS score is the sum total of all three subscales, and can range from 0 to 84.

Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities., Change from baseline at 16 weeks|Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), The EDSS is an ordinal clinical rating scale ranging from 0 (normal neurologic examination) to 10 (death due to MS) in half-point increments. It characterizes disability level and determines disability progression in people with MS. Higher scores reflect greater disability due to MS., Change from baseline at 16 weeks|Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS), The PDDS is a patient-reported outcome of disability in MS. The scale focuses mainly on how well individuals with MS walk. Scores range from 0 (normal function) to 8 (bedridden).

Scale ranges from 0-84 points, with higher scores indicating greater fatigue., 6 weeks|Change From Baseline in Vestibular-Ocular Reflex (VOR) Gain at 6 Weeks, The most common rotary chair testing is a battery of subtests, each at a specific rate (Hz) of chair rotation from side to side. The participant is secured in the chair in total darkness while the eyes are monitored by infrared cameras. We completed tests from 0.04 to 0.64 Hz to assess the vestibular system across a range of head movements. The chair and participant's head move together while the cameras track the velocity of the eyes; eye velocity reveals how the vestibular system responds to head velocity. VOR gain is the ratio of average chair (i.e. head) velocity to average eye velocity, and is represented on a unitless scale from 0 to 1. VOR gain close to 1 indicates that eye velocity is nearly equal and opposite to head velocity. While there are normative ranges for VOR gain, we are most interested in is change in mean gain (6-week tests minus baseline tests) for the active and placebo groups., 6 weeks|Change From Baseline in Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR) Asymmetry (Percentage Asymmetric) at 6 Weeks, Mean changes in VOR asymmetry, which is a measure of the strength of the eye responses in one direction compared with the other as measured by rotary chair testing at 6 weeks, will be compared for active and placebo treated subjects using t-tests, or other appropriate statistical analyses. A range of frequencies was tested from 0.04 Hz to 0.64 Hz, as is standard for rotary chair testing. The range of frequencies (i.e. chair speeds) assesses the vestibular system across a range of head movements. This helps to identify abnormality, which may manifest at different frequencies of movement. The measurement outcomes for rotary chair testing are gain, phase and asymmetry of the eye movements., 6 weeks|Change From Baseline in Vestibular Ocular Reflex (VOR) Phase (in Degrees) at 6 Weeks, Mean changes in VOR phase, which is a measure of the timing (in degrees) of the eye movements relative to the chair movement, as measured by rotary chair testing at 6 weeks, will be compared for active and placebo treated subjects using t-tests, or other appropriate statistical analyses.

4. affected part(s) rigid in flexion or extension., Baseline and 12 weeks","Difference in the Multiple Sclerosis Spacticy Scale (MSSS-88) Between Baseline and 12 Weeks, Multiple Sclerosis Spacticy Scale (MSSS-88) is a patient reported questionnaire rating scale to quantify the perspectives of the impact of spasticity on people with multiple sclerosis.

Scoring: Individual items are scored on a 4 point Likert scale: 1 (Not bothered at all), 2 (a little bothered), 3 (moderately bothered), 4 (extremely bothered).This questionnaire asks how bothered you have been by your spasticity in the past two weeks. By spasticity we mean muscle stiffness and spasms.The MSSS-88 is a reliable and valid, patient-based, interval-level measure of the impact of spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Scores were summed, without weighting or standardization, to generate ordinal-level total scores just as any other Likert-type scale. Missing responses to items can be replaced with the mean score of the items completed (person-specific item mean score) provided that 50% or more of the items in a scale have been completed. The range is 8-32 and higher scores mean poorer outcome., baseline, 12 weeks|Change in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score Between Baseline and Week 12, 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) is a quantitative measure of upper extremity function. Timed 25-Foot Walk (T 25 FW) is a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The patient is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely.

Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test-3 seconds (PASAT-3) is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability.

The MSFC is based on the concept that scores for these 3 dimensions-arm, leg, and cognitive function are combined to create a single score that can be used to detect change over time in a group of MS patients. This is done by creating Z-scores for each component of the MSFC. Implicit in this approach is the idea that patients who deteriorate or improve on all 3 component measures will have an overall larger change than patients who change on only 1 of the 3 measures. The MSFC score was transformed to z-scores, with higher scores indicating better outcome., Baseline, Week 12",,University of Rochester,Forest Laboratories,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,21,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: QUADRUPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR, OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",8049,2006-07,2009-02,2009-02,2008-03-18,2015-12-07,2015-12-07,"University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, 14642, United States",

NCT02835677,Integrating Caregiver Support Into MS Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02835677,,COMPLETED,"With loss of mobility in multiple sclerosis (MS) comes an increase in amount and types of caregiver assistance, with a concomitant increase in burden for the caregiver. In fact, effect on caregiver burden can be seen as a potential indicator of the efficacy of MS management, suggesting that the caregiver is an appropriate and independent target for MS therapeutic strategies.

MS patients report difficulty implementing and continuing with home exercise, mobility, and walking programs. This feasibility study will test integration of a successful behavioral caregiving intervention into clinical practice to improve functioning of Veterans with multiple sclerosis (MS) and their Caregivers. Caregivers of Veterans with MS will receive a behavioral caregiver intervention designed to address caregiver coping and management of patient concerns, with special focus on patient mobility and walking. A pre-post intervention design will compare outcomes for Veterans and Caregivers.

For Veterans, the intervention will target Caregiver participation in home-based Veteran mobility activities. MS Caregivers report high burden, stress, and depression involved in caring for their loved ones, especially as mobility declines and these outcomes are related to physical and emotional health status of the patient. For Caregivers, the intervention will focus on improving Caregiver coping and on managing MS-related problems. Outcomes for both will be measured at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months.

Study Objectives include:

* Test whether a caregiver intervention can be integrated into an MS clinical setting.
* Determine whether Caregiver outcomes are improved (depression, burden, anxiety, and number of Veteran MS problems and safety alerts reported).
* Determine whether Veteran outcomes are improved (Expanded Disability Status Scale, timed up and go test, self-efficacy, and depression).

This approach represents a paradigm shifting opportunity for improving current clinical practices for patients with progressive MS. If successful, this project will provide initial evidence for increasing patient access to the G-EO System, and this could be accomplished through ""regional technology centers"" using a rural health-delivery approach.

There are several novel aspects of the proposed trial: (1) the examination of a novel gait rehabilitation stimulus (G-EO System) that could alter current clinical practices; (2) the focus on patients with progressive MS who have gait impairment (i.e., those who have received minimal research attention), which was recently described as the greatest therapeutic challenge facing the MS community; and (3) a study design that accounts for standard therapy.

Specific Aims: The investigators designed a single-blinded, randomized pilot trial of electromechanically-assisted gait training using the G-EO System in patients with progressive MS with gait disability (EDSS=4.0-7.5).

Specific Aim 1 will establish the safety and feasibility of gait training using the G-EO System.

Scores range from 0 (no speed) to as fast as they are comfortable with the most common range being .1 to 1.5 meters per second., Gait speed for comfortable walking will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment (Pretest) and following study completion which occurred following 20 treatment visits (Posttest)|Two Minute Walk Test, A 2-minute walk (2MWT) test to determine walking endurance. Subjects will be asked to walk for 2 minutes along a 30m track. Subjects may stop and rest as often as needed. The outcome is the distance in meters traveled during the 2 minutes. Scores can range from 0 to 500 meters. An increase in distance following treatment when compared to pretest numbers would indicate improved muscular and cardiovascular endurance., Walking distance will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment (Pretest) and following study completion (Posttest). Pretest represents a time point prior to intervention training. Posttest represents the point following intervention completion.|Modified Fatigue Impact Scale, Subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating their level of perceived fatigue. The scores are divided into three different scales: physical, cognitive, and psychosocial. A total score is also calculated. Scale scores are represented by the following ranges: physical subscale ranges from 0 to 36; cognitive subscale from 0 to 40; and psychosocial subscale from 0 to 8. A total score has a range of 0 to 85. A higher score indicates greater fatigue. Decreases in scores over time indicate decreases in feelings of fatigue. Each scale including the total score is summed., Subjects perception of the their fatigue will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)|Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29, Subjects completed a 29 item questionnaire evaluating their level of health-related quality of life. The higher the score the greater the impact MS is having on their daily function. The 29 items are divided into a 20 item physical scale and 9 item psychological scale. Each item has four potential responses resulting in scores on the physical impact scale ranging from 20 to 80 and on the psychological impact scale ranging from 9 to 36. Final scores for each scale are achieved by summing the items for each of the two scales and then transforming them to a 100 point scale for easy comparison. On the 100 point scale, 0 would indicate no impact of the disease on daily function and 100 would indicate the greatest possible impact., Subjects perception of the their disability will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)|Fast Walking Speed, Fast Walking speed will be assessed using a Pressure Sensor Walkway. Participants will be asked to walk over a 14 foot pressure mat that will capture their walking speed.

Pretest represents a time point prior to intervention training. Posttest represents the point following intervention completion.","Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating their level of anxiety and depression. The questionnaire is comprised of two scales: a 7 item scale related to anxiety and 7 item scale related to depression. Each item within both scales is scored using a 0-3 scoring system depending upon the individual's answer. Both the anxiety scale and the depression scale can range in scores from 0 to 21. Although the 14 items were administered together, each set of seven questions was kept separate and scored separately to create a score for anxiety and one for depression. The scores for each scale were summed to provide a total score for anxiety and a separate score for depression. The higher the score the greater the severity. A score between 8-10 is consider mild, 11-14 is moderate, \>14 is severe for both scales., Subjects perception of the their anxiety and depression will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)|Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, Subjects completed a questionnaire evaluating their level of pain. There are 15 adjectives that describe the patient's pain. The patient ranks each of the words on a categoric scale of ""none, mild, moderate, severe. Sensory and affective scores will be computed separately. Scores are created from a summary of the responses using an intensity scale of 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate and 3 = severe. The higher the score the more severe the pain is for each of the subscales. For this study, sensory, affective, and total pain scores are reported. The minimum sensory, affective, and total score score would be zero. The maximum score for sensory is 33, affective is 12, and total is 45., Subjects perception of the their pain will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)|Late-Life Disability Inventory (LLFDI), Subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating their perceived level of disability. This tool assesses and responds to meaningful change in a persons disability (Ability to participate in life's activities). There is a 16 item disability component that is scored across two dimensions: frequency and limitation. Total scores and dimensional scores are created by summation and conversion to a 100 point scaled score. The instrument provides a table for converting the raw score to a scaled score. The lowest possible scale score is 0 and the highest score is 100 for both frequency and limitation. A higher score indicates greater functional ability and less disability.

Each dimension can be further assessed by analyzing domains. There are social and personal domains within the frequency dimension and instrumental and management domains within the limitations dimension. All domains are calculated as described before through summation and scale adjustment., Subjects perception of the their functional ability using the total score and dimensional scores will be assessed prior to the start of the treatment and following study completion (at 10 weeks)|Late-Life Function Inventory, Subjects will complete a questionnaire evaluating their perceived level of function.

NCT01444300,Dalfampridine for Imbalance in Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01444300,,COMPLETED,"Dalfampridine is a new medication that was FDA approved in 2010 to improve walking speed in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). People with MS walk slowly in part because MS damages the myelin insulation around nerves which slows conduction of messages from the brain to the leg muscles. Dalfampridine works by improving conduction in nerves with damaged myelin. Recent research indicates that imbalance in MS is in large part caused by poor conduction by the nerves that transmit information about the position of the legs to the brain. It is therefore likely that, by improving nerve conduction, dalfampridine will also improve imbalance in people with MS. Dalfampridine will be administered in this study by the same route (oral), dosage (10mg), and frequency (every 12 hours) approved by the FDA to improve walking speed in people with MS. The proposed pilot study will examine the effects of dalfampridine on imbalance in 24 subjects with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and imbalance. This small pilot study will help to show if dalfampridine improves imbalance in MS and will guide the design and implementation of a larger full scale study to definitively determine if dalfampridine improves balance and prevents falls in people with MS.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis|Fatigue,DRUG: Dalfampridine|DRUG: Placebo,"Change in Automatic Postural Response (APR )Latency, Automatic Postural Response (APR) latencies will be measured by Computerized Dynamic Posturography (CDP). The restoration of balance after an unexpected movement by Computerized Dynamic Posturography relies on automated postural responses in the upper and lower legs, trunk, shoulders, and neck muscles. APR latency is the reaction- time response to movements of the support surface on which the subject stands. These responses typically occur at onset latencies of \~100 milliseconds. In response to a change, both feet-in-place and stepping strategies can be used to recover balance, with the incidence of stepping responses becoming larger as the change magnitude increases voluntary movements in human subjects., Baseline to 12 weeks","Change in Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Questionnaire Scores, The ABC is an 11-point scale and subjects are asked to indicate personal level of confidence in doing specific activities without losing balance or becoming unsteady on a scale from 0% to 100%. The ratings are added (possible range =0 -1600) and divide by 16 to get each subject's ABC score.

NCT03500289,Ketamine for Treatment of MS Fatigue,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03500289,,COMPLETED,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating and degenerative disease of the central nervous system and, after trauma, is the most common cause of disability in young adults, affecting more than 400,000 individuals in the US. Of all the symptoms that can occur with MS, chronic fatigue is the most common and disabling, reported by at least 75% of patients at some point. Fatigue limits patients' daily activities, and challenges employment, resulting in substantial socioeconomic consequences. Despite this negative impact, fatigue treatments have been inconsistently studied, in part due to poorly understood underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Yet to be defined biological processes and lack of clear treatment targets have also hampered the development of drugs for fatigue. As a result, there are no medications approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of MS fatigue.

The investigators recently reported that riluzole, a medication with anti-glutamatergic effects, increased the fatigue severity in patients with relapsing MS who had participated in a clinical trial evaluating potential neuroprotective effects of riluzole versus placebo. Three other clinic trials which examined memantine effects on cognition in patient with MS also reported worsening fatigue as a major side effect. Memantine main mechanism of action is blocking the N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor. These observations prompted the investigators that glutamatergic transmission probably plays an important role in fatigue pathogenesis and modulating these pathways could have potential therapeutic effect on MS-related fatigue. A recent paper reported that ketamine, an NMDA receptor blocker with different kinetics compared to memantine, had a strong and prolonged effect in reducing fatigue in bipolar patients who participated in a clinical trial, evaluating anti-depressive effects of ketamine versus placebo. Interestingly, the effect of ketamine on fatigue was independent of its antidepressant effects.

The primary objective of this study is to determine if modulating glutamatergic transmission with ketamine is safe and efficacious in improving MS-related fatigue. These objectives will be answered in a proof of concept, randomized controlled trial of ketamine versus an active placebo (midazolam) in patients with relapsing or progressive MS who have clinically significant fatigue.

18 patients with MS and reported fatigue, will be randomized 2:1 to one infusion of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes versus one infusion of midazolam 0.05 mg/kg over 40 minutes. Midazolam is chosen as an active placebo to keep the participants blinded to participants' medication assignment. Primary outcome of the study will be Daily Fatigue Severity measured daily from day one through day seven post-infusion.

The total EDSS score ranged from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS), increasing in increments of 0.5 points. Higher scores indicated increased disability. Time to onset of 6-month CDW was defined as the time from randomization to the onset of a confirmed, sustained increase from baseline in EDSS score (of \>=1.5 points when the baseline score was 0, of \>=1.0 point when the baseline score was 0.5 to \<=5.5, of \>=0.5 points when the baseline EDSS score was \>5.5) over at least 6 months that was not attributable to another etiology., Baseline (Day 1) to approximately 48 months|Time to Onset of 3-Month Confirmed Disability Worsening as Assessed by Expanded Disability Status Scale, The EDSS was a disability scale that assessed the following 7 functional domains: visual, brainstem, pyramidal \[motor\], cerebellar \[coordination\], sensory, cerebral, and bowel/bladder. The total EDSS score ranged from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS), increasing in increments of 0.5 points. Higher scores indicated increased disability. Time to onset of 3-month CDW was defined as the time from randomization to the onset of a confirmed, sustained increase from baseline in EDSS score (of \>=1.5 points when the baseline score was 0, of \>=1.0 point when the baseline score was 0.5 to \<=5.5, of \>=0.5 points when the baseline EDSS score was \>5.5) over at least 3 months that was not attributable to another etiology., Baseline (Day 1) to approximately 48 months|Mean Number of New and/or Enlarging T2-Hyperintense Lesions Per Year, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed to identify number of new and/or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions defined as the sum of the individual number of new and/or enlarging T2 lesions starting from baseline up to and including the EOS visit., Baseline (Day 1) to approximately 48 months|Mean Number of New Gadolinium-Enhancing T1-Hyperintense Lesions Per Scan, MRI of the brain was performed to identify number of new Gd-enhancing T1-hyperintense lesions defined as the sum of the individual number of new Gd- enhancing T1-hyperintense lesions starting from baseline up to and including the EOS visit., Baseline (Day 1) to approximately 48 months|Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Assessed by the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at EOS, The SDMT was used to assess processing speed, divided attention, visual scanning, tracking and motor speed. It involved a simple substitution task using a reference key. The number of correct substitutions and number of items completed within a 90 second interval (maximum 110 seconds) were recorded. A decrease of 4 points from baseline on the SDMT was considered meaningful worsening. The score was the number of correctly coded items from 0-110 in 90 seconds; higher scores indicating a better outcome. Baseline was defined as the last available value prior to the first dose of study intervention., Baseline (Day 1) to EOS (up to approximately 48 months)|Change From Baseline in Cognitive Function as Assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test Second Edition (CVLT-II) at EOS, The CVLT-II was a verbal learning and memory test consisting of recall and recognition of a list of 16 words. For each assessment, 5 trials were completed. Total Correct Recall Trials 1-5 was scaled to a normalized T-score metric, which had a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10, the maximum possible score was 80 and a minimum was 0. Higher values indicated improved cognitive function. Baseline was defined as the last available value prior to the first dose of study intervention., Baseline (Day 1) to EOS (up to approximately 48 months)|Time to Onset of 6-Month Confirmed Disability Improvement (CDI) as Assessed by Expanded Disability Status Scale, The EDSS was a disability scale that assessed the following 7 functional domains: visual, brainstem, pyramidal \[motor\], cerebellar \[coordination\], sensory, cerebral, and bowel/bladder. The total EDSS score ranged from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS), increasing in increments of 0.5 points. Higher scores indicated increased disability. CDI was defined as a decrease of \>=1 point from baseline in the EDSS score lasting at least 6 months., Baseline (Day 1) to approximately 48 months|Percent Change in Brain Volume Loss at EOS Compared to Month 6, MRI of the brain was performed at the specified timepoints to detect the changes in brain volume loss., Month 6 to EOS (up to approximately 48 months)|Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 (MSQoL-54) Questionnaire Score at EOS, MSQoL-54 was standardized instrument comprising generic and MS-specific items. This 54-item instrument generated 12 subscales and 2 single-item measures (satisfaction with sexual function \[1 item\]; change in health \[1 item\]). 12 subscales were: a: physical health (10 items), b: health perceptions (5 items), c: energy (5 items), d: role limit physical (4 items), e: sexual function (4 items), f: pain (3 items), g: social function (3 items), h: health distress (4 items), i: overall quality of life (2 items), j: emotional well-being (5 items), k: role limitations emotional (3 items) and l: cognitive function (4 items). Physical and mental health composite score were calculated as weighted sum of 'a to h' and 'i to l' subscales respectively. Each composite score was transformed linearly to common 0 (worst) to 100 (best) score range; higher score indicated improved quality of life. Baseline was defined as last available value prior to first dose of study intervention., Baseline (Day 1) to EOS (up to approximately 48 months)|Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (TESAEs), TEAEs Leading to Permanent Study Intervention Discontinuation and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs), An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. SAE was any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: resulted in death, was life-threatening, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent disability/incapacity, was a congenital anomaly/birth defect or was an important medical event. An AESI was an AE (serious or nonserious) of scientific and medical concern specific to the Sponsor's product or program for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor was required.

Participants without a sustained disease progression event were censored on the date of their last assessment or last dose of study drug, whichever was later., From first dose to the end of the 24-month treatment period|Percentage of Participants Who Were Gadolinium Enhancing (GdE) Lesion-Free at Month 24, Participants were considered lesion free at Month 24 if they did not show evidence of GdE lesions at the Month 24 MRI scan.

MRI images were assessed and scored by an independent MRI analysis center with no knowledge of treatment assignment or outcomes., Month 24|Percentage of Participants Who Were New or Enlarging T2 Lesion-Free at Month 24, MRI images were assessed and scored by an independent MRI analysis center with no knowledge of treatment assignment or outcomes., Month 24|Percent Change From Baseline in Normalized Brain Volume to Month 24, Brain volume (a measure of brain atrophy) was measured by brain MRI scans that were assessed and scored by an independent MRI analysis center with no knowledge of treatment assignment or outcomes., Baseline and Month 24|Change From Baseline to Month 24 in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score Including the Low-Contrast Letter Acuity (LCLA) Test, The MSFC-LCLA is a battery including the following 4 individual scales:

* Timed 25-Foot Walk is an ambulation measure of walking 25 feet with time taken recorded in seconds
* 9-Hole Peg Test (9HPT) is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function
* Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a measure of executive cognitive function that assesses processing speed, flexibility, and calculation ability
* Low-Contrast Letter Acuity Test (LCLA) used a standardized set of charts to assess low contrast visual acuity, charts are scored according to the number of letters that are identified correctly

Z-scores were calculated for for each component and averaged to create an overall composite score, using the study population as the reference population. A Z-score represents the number of standard deviations a patient's test result is higher (Z \> 0) or lower (Z \< 0) than the average test result (Z = 0) of the reference population. A positive change indicates improvement., Baseline to Month 24|Mean Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life (MSQOL)-54 Physical Health Composite Summary and Mental Health Composite Summary Scores, The MSQOL-54 is a multidimensional health-related QOL measure that combines both generic and MS-specific items into a single instrument. The instrument includes 12 subscales, two summary scores, and two single-item measures.

The two summary scores - physical health and mental health - are derived from a weighted combination of scale scores.

The physical health composite score includes Physical function, Health perceptions, Energy/fatigue, Role limitations - physical, Pain, Sexual function, Social function, and Health distress.

The mental health composite score includes Health distress, Overall quality of life, Emotional well-being, Role limitations - emotional, and Cognitive function.

Each composite summary score has a range from 0 to 100 where higher scores indicate better quality of life. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline to Month 24|Number of Participants With Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the investigational product (IP), including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of an IP whether or not considered related to the IP. Serious AEs were events that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, were congenital abnormalities/birth defects, or important medical events which may have required medical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes.

The investigator assessed the severity of AEs as mild, moderate, or severe and the relationship of each AE to treatment as unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or related based on timing and other known factors such as clinical state, environment, or other therapies., From the first dose of study drug up to the first dose of the open-label extension study RPC01-3001, or up to 28 days after last dose for participants who did not continue into the open-label extension study; median duration of treatment was 24 months.",,Celgene,,ALL,ADULT,PHASE3,1320,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation:

NCT00678496,Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Software for the Treatment of Depression in People With Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00678496,CoSMoS,COMPLETED,"Guidance issued by the United Kingdom (UK) National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends the use of computerised cognitive behavioural therapy (CCBT) 'Beating the Blues' (BtB) in treatment of depression. However CCBT has not been designed specifically for use by people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and may not be effective or appropriate for use by people with physical disabilities or cognitive symptoms. There would therefore be value in conducting a trial of the effectiveness of CCBT for depression in people with MS. The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of a randomised control trial (RCT) of CCBT for depression in people with MS. The objective is to undertake a pilot RCT of comparison of CCBT with usual care including 3 month follow up to identify a realistic patient recruitment rate and provide reliable estimates of other parameters needed for designing a definitive RCT including the sample size. Other outcomes to be measured include estimates of the effect on depression and quality of life. Participants will be assessed as experiencing clinical levels of depression and be recruited from two participating MS Centres. The outcomes of the study will be (1) preliminary indication of the impact of CCBT on depression in MS; and, (2) a well researched protocol for a definitive RCT of the effectiveness of CCBT in treating depression in people with MS.",YES,Depression|Multiple Sclerosis,OTHER: CBT Software|OTHER: Treatment as usual,"Change in Self-reported Symptoms of Depression, as Measured by Total BDI-II Score, Beck Depression Inventory II-21 Item (BDI-II) - a self-report measure of severity of symptoms of depression.

Disability progression was considered confirmed when the increase in the EDSS was confirmed at a regularly scheduled visit at least 12 weeks after the initial documentation of neurological worsening.

The MSFCS is based on the concept that scores for these three dimensions (arm, leg, and cognitive function) are combined to create a single score (the MSFC) that can be used to detect change over time in a group of participants with MS. Since the three primary measures differ in what they actually measure, a common composite score for the three different measures i.e., Z- score was selected for the purpose. MSFC Score = {Z arm, average + Z leg, average + Z cognitive} / 3.0. The results from each of these three tests are transformed into Z-scores and averaged to yield a composite score for each participant at each time point. A score of +1 indicates that, on average, an individual scored 1 standard deviation (SD) better than the reference population and a score of -1 indicates that an individual scored 1 SD worse than the reference population., Baseline, Week 96|Percent Change in Brain Volume as Detected by Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) From Week 24 to Week 96 In Double Blind Period, Brain volume was recorded as an absolute ""normalized"" value at the baseline visit then recorded at subsequent visits as a percentage change relative to the absolute value at the baseline visit. Therefore, brain volume at Week 24 was calculated as the brain volume at the baseline visit multiplied by 1 + (\[percentage change in brain volume from baseline visit to Week 24\]/100). Estimates are from analysis based on mixed-effect model of repeated measures (MMRM) using unstructured covariance matrix: Percentage Change = Brain Volume at Week 24 + Geographical Region (US vs. ROW) + Baseline EDSS (\< 4.0 vs. \>= 4.0) + Week + Treatment + Treatment\*Week (repeated values over Week) + Brain Volume at Week 24\*Week.

It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores (domains) as well as psychometrically based physical and mental health summary measures. The SF-36 taps 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, emotional well-being, social functioning, vitality, and general health perceptions. The 8 scales are further summarized to 2 distinct higher-ordered clusters: the PCS and mental composite t-score (MCS). The range for all 8 domains as well as for the composite t- scores is from 0 to 100 with 100 as best possible health status and 0 as worst health status., Baseline, Week 96|Percentage of Participants Who Have No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) up to Week 96 In Double Blind Period, NEDA was defined only for participants with a baseline EDSS score \>=2.0. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis). Participants who completed the 96- week treatment period were considered as having evidence of disease activity if at least one protocol- defined relapse (PDR), a confirmed disability progression (CDP) event or at least one MRI scan showing MRI activity (defined as Gd-enhancing T1 lesions, or new or enlarging T2 lesions) was reported during the 96-week treatment period, otherwise the participant was considered as having NEDA., Week 96|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), AEs included infusion related reactions (IRRs) and serious MS relapses, but excluded non-serious MS relapses.

NCT02208050,A Study of the Effectiveness of Fampridine in Improving Upper Limb Function in MS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02208050,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of treatment with fampridine in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS) with upper limb dysfunction (as defined by a 9-HPT time of between 15-90 seconds) and Kurtzke EDSS scores in the range 4.0-7.0 on upper limb function assessed by the nine-hole peg test (9-HPT) and the Jebson Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT).

Fampridine has been shown to be effective in improving motor function, specifically walking ability in prior studies in this patient population and is currently licensed for this use in Europe and the United States. Upper limb dysfunction is common in SPMS and PPMS and often underestimated. Fampridine effects action potential conduction in demyelinated nerve fibres and we would hypothesise that the improvement previously reported in walking ability would be similar to that on upper limb dysfunction.

This outcome measure was considered confirmatory only when results of both studies WA21092 and WA21093 were combined. Disability progression was considered confirmed when the increase in the EDSS was confirmed at a regularly scheduled visit at least 24 weeks after the initial documentation of neurological worsening. Participants who had initial disability progression with no confirmatory EDSS assessment and who were on treatment at time of clinical cut-off date were censored at the date of their last EDSS assessment., Week 108|Number of T1 Hypointense Lesions During the Double-Blind Treatment, The total number of new T1-Hypo-Intense Lesions (Chronic Black Holes) for all participants in the treatment group was calculated as the sum of the individual number of new lesions at Weeks 24, 48, and 96., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score to Week 96, MSFC score consists of: A) Timed 25-Foot walk; B) 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT); and C) Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT-3 version). The MSFCS is based on the concept that scores for these three dimensions (arm, leg, and cognitive function) are combined to create a single score (the MSFC) that can be used to detect change over time in a group of participants with MS. Since the three primary measures differ in what they actually measure, a common composite score for the three different measures i.e., Z- score was selected for the purpose. MSFC Score = {Z arm, average + Z leg, average + Z cognitive} / 3.0. The results from each of these three tests are transformed into Z-scores and averaged to yield a composite score for each participant at each time point. A score of +1 indicates that, on average, an individual scored 1 standard deviation (SD) better than the reference population and a score of -1 indicates that an individual scored 1 SD worse than the reference population., Baseline, Week 96|Percent Change in Brain Volume as Detected by Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) From Week 24 to Week 96, Brain volume was recorded as an absolute ""normalized"" value at the baseline visit then recorded at subsequent visits as a percentage change relative to the absolute value at the baseline visit. Therefore, brain volume at Week 24 was calculated as the brain volume at the baseline visit multiplied by 1 + (\[percentage change in brain volume from baseline visit to Week 24\]/100). Estimates are from analysis based on mixed-effect model of repeated measures (MMRM) using unstructured covariance matrix: Percentage Change = Brain Volume at Week 24 + Geographical Region (US vs. ROW) + Baseline EDSS (\< 4.0 vs. \>= 4.0) + Week + Treatment + Treatment\*Week (repeated values over Week) + Brain Volume at Week 24\*Week., From Week 24 up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) Physical Component Summary (PCS) Score at Week 96, The SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores (domains) as well as psychometrically based physical and mental health summary measures. The SF-36 taps 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, physical role functioning, emotional role functioning, emotional well-being, social functioning, vitality, and general health perceptions. The 8 scales are further summarized to 2 distinct higher-ordered clusters: the PCS and mental composite t-score (MCS). The range for all 8 domains as well as for the composite t- scores is from 0 to 100 with 100 as best possible health status and 0 as worst health status., Baseline, Week 96|Percentage of Participants Who Have No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) up to Week 96, NEDA was defined only for participants with a baseline EDSS score \>=2.0. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 (normal neurological exam) to 10 (death due to multiple sclerosis). Participants who completed the 96- week treatment period were considered as having evidence of disease activity if at least one protocol- defined relapse (PDR), a confirmed disability progression (CDP) event or at least one MRI scan showing MRI activity (defined as Gd-enhancing T1 lesions, or new or enlarging T2 lesions) was reported during the 96-week treatment period, otherwise the participant was considered as having NEDA., Week 96|Number of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs), AEs included infusion related reactions (IRRs) and serious MS relapses, but excluded non-serious MS relapses.

NCT03896217,Simvastatin in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03896217,MS-OPT,COMPLETED,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition which is a common cause of disability in young people. It is thought to be an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system begins to attack itself. The cause of MS is unknown but is thought to be a mix of genetic and environmental factors. There are treatments available for early stages of MS, but the later stage known as Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) has no current treatment.

Statins are a safe treatment traditionally used to reduce cholesterol levels. However, statins also have other effects which could reduce the progression of SPMS, such as effects on the immune system and circulation. A recent study (Chataway et al., 2014) showed that treatment with high-dose simvastatin, a type of statin, reduced the progression of SPMS but no effect on the immune system was seen. It is possible that simvastatin does not treat the immune system but improves how the blood and blood vessels in the brain work in this disease.

The purpose of the clinical trial is to test how Simvastatin (80mg/day) may slow down disease progression in people living with SPMS compared to placebo (dummy pill). Participants will receive either Simvastatin or placebo and will be asked to take 2 tablets daily, for up to 17 weeks.",YES,Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Simvastatin,"Effect on Cerebral Blood Flow in White Matter, Gray Matter, Deep White Matter, Deep Gray Matter, and Thalamus, To compare patients on simvastatin or placebo using multiple linear regressions.

With the macromolecular volume being made up of 50% myelin, we are able to use an in-house analysis pipeline to calculate the MTV - a surrogate marker of brain myelin volume. This metric, alongside diffusion weighted imaging will provide micro-structural detail into the cross-sectional and longitudinal changes occurring in the brain parenchyma of people with progressive MS., At week 16|OCT-A: Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer, Inner retinal thickness will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a method of retinal imaging which is non-invasive and involves the patient holding their head still and staring at a dim light while imaging takes place. Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness is a strong candidate as a biomarker of axonal degeneration in MS., At week 16|OCT-A: Vessel Density, OCT-A images will be processed to produce quantitative data of perfusion indices. Vessel density (VD) is defined as the ""percentage area occupied by vessels in the segmented area., At week 16|Clinical Outcome: EDSS, To examine the clinical effect of simvastatin treatment as reported by the clinician. Clinician observed expanded disability status score (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in MS and records changes in disability over time. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 (no disability) to 10 (death due to MS) in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist and encompasses pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel/bladder function in addition to visual, cerebral and other functions. Changes in score (including no changes) will be recorded to determine progression of disability., At week 16|Clinical Outcomes: MSFC: 25 Foot Timed Walk, To examine the clinical effect of simvastatin treatment as reported by the clinician . Multiple Sclerosis Function Composite (MSFC) includes the 25 foot timed foot walk (25TFW), which involves marking a 25-foot distance in an unobstructed hallway; an assistive device (if needed) may be used by the participant and recorded.

Multiple Sclerosis Function Composite (MSFC) includes the 9 hole peg test (9HPT). The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed immediately by two consecutive trials of the non-dominant hand). It is important that the 9-HPT be administered on a solid table (not a rolling hospital bedside table) and that the 9-HPT apparatus be anchored (e.g., with Dycem). The pegs are selected one at a time, using one hand only, and put into the holes as quickly as possible in any order until all the holes are filled. Then, without pausing, the pegs are removed one at a time and returned to the container. This is timed and recorded at the time-points described., At week 16|Clinical Outcomes: SDMT, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is measure of cognitive impairment. The subject is asked to match single digits to symbols using a key as a guide that pairs the numbers to the symbols. They are presented with a page headed by a key that pairs the single digits 1-9 with nine symbols and they then write or orally report their responses in a scoring form. It can be administered in oral and written form and is timed and guided by a trained examiner ie. suitably qualified member of the research team. Changes in scores were recorded over the time-points described. Scores range from 0 to 110, with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning., At week 16|Clinical Outcomes: Frontal Executive Functioning: FAB, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). The FAB is a brief tool that can be used at the bedside or in a clinic setting to assist in discriminating between dementias with a frontal dysexecutive phenotype and dementia of Alzheimer""s Type (DAT). The FAB has validity in distinguishing Fronto-temporal type dementia from DAT in mildly demented patients (MMSE \> 24). Total score is from a maximum of 18, higher scores indicating better performance. Changes in scores were recorded over the time-points described. The FAB evaluates executive functions through six subtests, including conceptualization, mental flexibility, motor programming, sensitivity to interference, inhibitory control, and environmental autonomy. Each subtest is scored from 0 to 3, yielding a total score range of 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate better executive functioning. The total score is calculated by summing the six subtest scores., At week 20|Patient-Reported Outcomes: MSIS-29v2 Questionnaires., To examine the clinical effect of simvastatin treatment as reported by patient reported outcome measures. Patient reported multiple sclerosis impact scale version 2 (MSIS-29v2) is a self-administered questionnaire covering 29 items that asks to what degree MS has impacted the person physically and mentally over the past two weeks. It consists of 29 items divided into two subscales: Physical Impact (20 items; score range: 20-100) and Psychological Impact (9 items; score range: 9-45). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect a greater negative impact of MS on the individual's quality of life., At week 16|Patient-Reported Outcomes: MSWT-12V2 Questionnaires., Patient reported Multiple Sclerosis Walking Test version 2 (MSWT-12V2) is a 12 item self-administered questionnaire that measures walking performance over the previous two weeks. Each items is summed to generate a total score which is then transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater impact on walking. Changes in scores will be recorded over the time-points described., At week 16|Health Economic Outcomes: EQ5D5L, The EuroQol Health-Related Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized instrument for assessing health-related quality of life across five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain is rated on a five-level scale, ranging from 1 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems). The EQ-5D-5L also includes a visual analogue scale (VAS), on which individuals rate their overall health from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state).

NCT04261790,Effects of Ocrelizumab on B-cell Tolerance Defect in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04261790,,COMPLETED,"B-cells have an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Ocrelizumab, a medication that targets B-cells have been found to be highly effective in stopping the disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS.

The efficacy of ocrelizumab might be related to the specific pattern of B-cell tolerance defect in patients with MS and the potential of its normalization with treatment with ocrelizumab. By analyzing the reactivity of recombinant antibodies expressed from single B-cells, the investigators' collaborators have demonstrated that the pattern of B-cell tolerance defect is different in people with MS who only display an impaired removal of developing autoreactive B-cells in the periphery while central B-cell tolerance in the bone marrow is functional in most patients. In contrast, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type-1 diabetes (T1D) or Sjögren's syndrome (SS) show defective central and peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoints. As a consequence, while anti-B-cell therapy does not correct defective early B-cell tolerance checkpoints in T1D and only temporarily slows down autoimmune processes before newly generated autoreactive B-cells likely induce patient relapse, the investigators postulate that the efficacy of ocrelizumab in MS may be linked to normal central B-cell tolerance and the production of a normal B-cell and T-cell compartment after ocrelizumab therapy.

In an open-label study, 10 patients with relapsing MS will be treated with two courses of ocrelizumab and will be followed clinically and radiologically for at least two and a half years.

Walking limitations were reported by the patients using categories, generating a total transformed score ranging from 0-100. Higher scores reflected greater impairment.

The change from baseline in MSWS-12 converted score was analyzed using a repeated measures model., Baseline, Month 12 and Month 24|Number of T1 Gd-enhancing Lesions Per Patient Per Scan, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain were performed every 12 months. MRI evaluation during the Core Part included the number of T1 gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesions. Each MRI scan was reviewed by a local neurologist and by a central blinded MRI reading center.

The number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions per patient per scan was analyzed using a negative binomial regression model., Baseline, Month 12 and Month 24|Number of New or Enlarging T2 Lesions Per Patient Per Year, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain were performed every 12 months. MRI evaluation during the Core Part included the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions. Each MRI scan was reviewed by a local neurologist and by a central blinded MRI reading center.

The number of new or enlarging T2 lesions compared to previous scan was analyzed using a repeated measures negative binomial regression model., Baseline, Month 12 and Month 24|Percent Brain Volume Change (PBVC) Relative to Baseline, Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the brain were performed every 12 months. MRI evaluation during the Core Part included the percentage change in brain volume. Each MRI scan was reviewed by a local neurologist and by a central blinded MRI reading center.

PBVC relative to baseline was analyzed using a repeated measures model (for normally distributed data) with visit as a categorical factor., Baseline, Month 12 and Month 24|Number of Participants With 3-month CDP Events as Measured by EDSS in the Subgroup of SPMS Patients With/Without Superimposed Relapses, The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assesses neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS). EDSS scale ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Confirmed disability is defined as an increase of score of 1 point in patients with baseline score of 3.0 to 5.0 and 0.5 point increase with baseline score of 5.5 to 6.5.

The definition of 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) was an increase from baseline in EDSS as defined before sustained for at least 3 months.

The following secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) groups were defined for the analysis of this endpoint:

* Without superimposed relapses in the 2 years prior to study start (baseline definition)
* With superimposed relapses in the 2 years prior to study start (baseline definition)
* Without superimposed relapses during the Core Part of study (post-treatment)
* With superimposed relapses during the Core Part of study (post-treatment) Data was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model, Baseline, every 3 months up to the maximum of approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With 3-month CDP Events as Measured by EDSS in the Subgroup of Rapidly and Not Rapidly Evolving Patients, The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assesses neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS). EDSS scale ranges from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). Confirmed disability is defined as an increase of score of 1 point in patients with baseline score of 3.0 to 5.0 and 0.5 point increase with baseline score of 5.5 to 6.5.

The definition of 3-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) was an increase from baseline in EDSS as defined before sustained for at least 3 months.

Rapidly evolving patients are defined as subjects with 1.5 or greater EDSS change in the 2 years prior to or at study start and disability progression in the 2 years prior to study start was not adjudicated.

Data was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model., Baseline, every 3 months up to the maximum of approximately 3 years|Number of Participants With 3-month CDP Events as Measured by EDSS in the Subgroup of Patients With and Without Moderate/Severe Disease Course, The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) assesses neurologic impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS).

NCT02687919,Evaluation of a Modified Paleolithic Dietary Intervention in the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02687919,,COMPLETED,"This is a research study. The investigators are inviting participants to participate in this research study between the ages of 18-45, who have stable Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), are able to walk 25 ft with/without an assistive device, and have none of the following: liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, active heart disease, heart block or arrhythmias, bleeding disorders, concurrent diuretic use, anti-coagulation or anti-platelet use, psychosis or other psychiatric disorder likely to impact ability to comply with study procedures, any change in prescription medication for a mental health problem such as depression or anxiety in the last three months.

The purpose of this research study is to determine whether or not a modified Paleolithic diet results in any change in health in persons with RRMS compared to usual care. The investigators define usual care as the typical or usual physician recommendations for the treatment of RRMS.

The Paleolithic diet (or Paleo diet), also referred to as the caveman diet, Stone Age diet, and hunter-gatherer diet, is a modern nutritional plan based on the presumed ancient diet of wild plants and animals of ancestral humans during the Paleolithic era (a period of about 2.5 million years duration that ended around 10,000 years ago with the development of agriculture). The diet consists mainly of fish, grass-fed pasture raised meats, vegetables, fruit, fungi, roots, and nuts, and excludes grains, legumes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils.

To the investigators' knowledge, most neurologists prescribe medications that may reduce or prevent future disability, but few prescribe dietary modifications unless needed for other concomitant disease.",YES,"Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-remitting",OTHER: Modified Paleo diet,"Change in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)-9 Score, Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that a modified Paleolithic diet reduces effects of fatigue in subjects with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), compared to controls, in: (a) daily life as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score.

A 9-item sel-report questionnaire related to how fatigue interferes with certain activities and rates its severity, items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The minimum score is 9 and maximum score is 63.

This a Composite Score Based on the Measurement of Time in Seconds for the Three Separate Measurements., Explore preliminary clinical responses in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis subjects treated with Raltegravir, compared with baseline as measured by Patient Reported Outcomes (Questionnaires). The MSFC is a composite score consisting of the standardly derived composite score from 9-hole peg test (9HPT), timed walk and PASAT scores. 9HPT is measured as timed speed to complete the task; higher scores indicate less disability. The 25-foot walk is measured as timed speed; higher scores indicate less disability. The Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. It is a timed speed test measured in seconds. In the PASAT a lower score indicates less disability., Baseline and monthly until month 6.|Changes in Kurtzke Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score, The Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in multiple sclerosis. The scale has been developed by John F. Kurtzke. The EDSS quantifies disability in eight Functional Systems (FS) and allows neurologists to assign a Functional System Score (FSS) in each of these. 0 = Normal 1-1.5 = No disability, but some abnormal neurological signs 2-2.5 = Minimal disability 3-4.5 = Moderate disability, affecting daily activities, but you can still walk. A lower score indicates less disability.

5-8 = More severe disability, impairing your daily activities and requiring assistance with walking 8.5-9.5 = Very severe disability, restricting you to bed 10 = Death EDSS scores were measured monthly over 6 months and the mean of the measurements for the first three months (baseline) was recorded to use calculate the change from baseline compared with the mean of measurements taken monthly during the second three months (treatment)., Baseline and monthly to month 6|Cumulative Number of Gd-T1 Enhancing Lesions, This measure is the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions as determined by MRI taken on the monthly basis during the six months of the study., At Baseline and monthly for 6 months|Percent of Subjects With Scans Free From Enhancing Lesions in Raltegravir Treated Subjects vs. Baseline, This measure is the cumulative percentage of subjects who had scans free from Gd enhancing lesions during the first three months (baseline) compared with the second three months (treatment). These percentages are expressed as a total percentage for the baseline and for the treatment periods., Baseline to 6 months","Mean Number of Adverse Events Per Patient, This outcome will be assessed by blood and urine sampling; collection of patient reported symptoms and neurological and physical exams.

This measure is the total number of adverse events recorded for each type of event during the study period. The number of participants is 31 which is the number screened and enrolled in the study. Eleven participants did not meet the criterion for baseline i.e. having a gadolinium enhancing lesion on MRI at the baseline visit and therefore did not continue to the baseline observation period. The adverse events for the 11 participants who did not begin the study observation period were recorded during the screening period and added to the 20 participants who were studied during the 6 months of the study. Adverse events are recorded as total number during the study period. Each patient may have had more than one adverse event., Screening to six months|Effect of Raltegravir Therapy on Specific Inflammatory Marker of MS Activity., Measured by Human C-Reactive Protein (HCRP) which is a measure of general inflammation.

NCT00950248,Clinical Trial of Idebenone in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (IPPoMS),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00950248,IPPoMS,COMPLETED,"Background:

* Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that progressively weakens and destroys the pathways of the nervous system. About 10 percent to 15 percent of patients develop primary-progressive MS (PP-MS), characterized by progressive accumulation of disability from the disease onset, without any marked improvements or relapses. There are currently no effective treatments for PP-MS.
* Idebenone is a manmade drug that is similar to a naturally occurring compound known as coenzyme Q10, a common dietary supplement. Research data suggest that idebenone may be able to limit demyelination and death of brain cells and thereby slow or halt the progression of neurological dysfunction such as that occurring in MS.

Objectives:

\- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of using idebenone to treat primary progressive MS.

Eligibility:

\- Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have been diagnosed with primary progressive multiple sclerosis.

Design:

* The study will last 3 years and will be divided into two parts: a 1-year pretreatment baseline and 2 years of treatment with either idebenone or a placebo.
* Pre-treatment study: approximately 5 clinic visits over 1 year.
* Visit 1: Comprehensive medical history and neurological examination, with brain scans and neurological tests.
* Visit 2: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the spine and lymphocytapheresis (withdrawal of white blood cells for testing).
* Visit 3: Lumbar puncture.
* Visit 4: Skin biopsy.
* Visit 5: Repeat MRI of the brain and spinal cord, as well as neurological tests; these tests will be scheduled over 2 days.
* After the five pretreatment visits, patients will receive a 6-month supply of study medication (either idebenone or a placebo) to take three times a day with food
* Patients will continue to have regular followup clinic visits with brain MRI scans, blood tests, and other evaluations of brain and nervous system function. Randomly selected participants will have additional MRI scans for further safety precautions.",YES,Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Idebenone|OTHER: placebo,"Change in the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Combinatorial Weight-Adjusted Disability Score (CombiWISE) From Baseline to Treatment Phase, The AUCs of the CombiWISE scores during the 2-year treatment period was analyzed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model with the AUC of the pre-treatment CombiWISE scores, Baseline (Month 0) CombiWISE score and Baseline age as covariates.

CombiWISE is a composite scale derived from Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) , Scripps Neurological Disability Scale (SNRS), times 25 foot walk (25FW), and non-dominant hand of 9 hole peg test (9HPT) with a minimum value of 0 (no disability) and maximum value of 100 (maximum disability).

The AUC values were calculated for both the pre-treatment baseline phase (from Months -12, -6, and 0) and for the double-blind phase (from Months 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24).

Because the follow-up times varied from patient to patient, the AUC values were made comparable by scaling them by dividing the AUC value by the square of the actual duration (in years) of each of the phases., 1-year pre-treatment baseline vs 2-year treatment period","Change in the AUC of Individualized Rates of Enlargement of Ventricular Volume From Baseline to Treatment Phase, The AUCs of the Ventricular volume scores (individualized rates of enlargement of segmented volume of lateral and 3rd ventricles) during the baseline and the 2-year treatment period were assessed using an ANCOVA model with the AUC of the pre-treatment Volumetric score, Baseline (Month 0) Volumetric score, and group as covariates.

The patients who did not have an event during the study were censored at the time of the last assessment of EDSS-plus.

The study has two periods:

* Placebo Controlled Period: 12 months of 40 mg administered three times a week by subcutaneous injection or matching placebo.
* Open Label Extension Period: All subjects will continue treatment with GA 40 mg administered three times a week, until this dose strength is commercially available for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients or until the development of this GA dose regimen is stopped by the Sponsor",YES,Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Glatiramer acetate (GA)|DRUG: Placebo,"Total Number of Confirmed Relapses During the Placebo Controlled (PC) Treatment Period Estimated by Negative Binomial Regression, Relapses were monitored throughout the study. During the PC Period, two neurologists/physicians assessed subjects' general medical and neurological evaluations separately. A relapse was defined as the appearance of 1+ new neurological abnormalities or the reappearance of 1+ previously observed neurological abnormalities lasting \>= 48 hours and immediately preceded by an improving neurological state of at \>=30 days from onset of previous relapse. An event was counted as a relapse only when the subject's symptoms were accompanied by observed objective neurological changes, consistent with \>= one of the following: - An increase of \>= 0.5 in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score as compared to previous evaluation. - An increase of one grade in the actual score of \>=2 of the 7 functional systems (FS), as compared to previous evaluation. - An increase of 2 grades in the actual score of one FS as compared to the previous evaluation. Adjusted mean values are displayed., Day 1 to 12 months|Annualized Rate of Confirmed Relapses Comparing Early Starters to Delayed Starters Estimated by Negative Binomial Regression, The annualized relapse rate (ARR) was calculated for the study by dividing the cumulative number of confirmed relapses by the number of person-years of exposure to treatment. The analysis of the annualized relapse rate is based on estimating a contrast (early start vs delayed start) derived from a baseline-adjusted, Negative Binomial Regression model to the number of confirmed relapses observed during study (post randomization) with an ""offset"" based on the log of exposure to treatment., Day 1 up to 6.5 years","The Cumulative Number of New/Enlarging T2 Lesions Taken at Month 6 and Month 12 During the Placebo Controlled (PC) Treatment Period Estimated by Negative Binomial Regression, T2 lesions are hyperintense brain lesions that show on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are associated with multiple sclerosis. The cumulative number of T2 lesions at Months 6 and 12 that are new or enlarged as compared to the baseline MRI are offered. Note that the two timeframes (Months 6 and 12) are combined. Adjusted mean is based on negative binomial regression, adjusted for baseline number of T2 lesions and country or geographical region as covariates., Baseline (Day -7), Month 6, Month 12|The Cumulative Number of Gadolinium (Gd)-Enhanced Lesions on T1-Weighted Images At Month 6 and Month 12 of the Placebo-Controlled (PC) Treatment Period Estimated by Negative Binomial Regression, The cumulative number of gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions on T1-weighted images at Months 6 and 12 as compared to the baseline MRI are offered. Note that the two timeframes (Months 6 and 12) are combined. Adjusted mean is based on negative binomial regression with an ""offset"" employing the log of the proportion of the number of the available post-baseline scans to adjust for missing MRI scans (if any), adjusted for baseline number of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images and country or geographical region as covariates., Baseline (Day -7), Month 6, Month 12|Brain Atrophy As Defined by the Percent of Change in Normalized Brain Volume From Baseline to Month 12 During the Placebo Controlled (PC) Treatment Period, The analysis of brain atrophy as defined by the percentage change in normalized brain volume from baseline to Month 12 was based on the outcome of a contrast (GA 40 mg TIW vs. placebo) derived from a baseline-adjusted ANCOVA. In addition to the treatment group, the model included the following covariates: - SIENAX normalized brain volume at baseline. - The number of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images at baseline. - country or geographical region.

T2 lesions are hyperintense brain lesions that show on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are associated with multiple sclerosis. The number of T2 lesions at Months 6, 12 and 36 that are new or enlarged as compared to the baseline MRI are offered. Adjusted mean is based on negative binomial regression, adjusted for baseline number of T2 lesions and country or geographical region as covariates. An ""offset"" employing the log of the proportion of the number of the available post-placebo-controlled baseline (PCBL) scans was used to adjust for missing MRI scans., Baseline (Day -7), Month 6, Month 12, Month 36|The Cumulative Number of Gadolinium (Gd)-Enhanced Lesions on T1-Weighted Images At Months 6, 12 and 36 Estimated by Negative Binomial Regression, All data accumulated from screening, the PC Treatment period up to the end of the Open Label (OL) period are combined and referred to as the Long Term Period. The cumulative number of gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced lesions on T1-weighted images at Months 6, 12 and 36 as compared to the baseline MRI are offered. Adjusted mean is based on negative binomial regression The model was fit using an autoregressive covariance structure. Covariates used: number of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images at placebo-controlled baseline and country or geographical region. The cumulative number is derived from all the data points before it. For example, if the participant skipped one time point in between the baseline and 36 months, then it cannot be calculated., Baseline (Day -7), Month 6, Month 12, Month 36|Brain Atrophy As Defined by the Percent of Change in Brain Volume From Baseline to Months 6, 12 and 36 Estimated by a Mixed Model for Repeated Measures, The analysis of brain atrophy as defined by the percentage change in brain volume from baseline to Months 6, 12 and 36 was performed using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) with SIENAX normalized brain volume at baseline, number of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline, and country or geographical region as fixed effects.

An adverse event was defined in the protocol as any untoward medical occurrence that develops or worsens in severity during the conduct of a clinical study and does not necessarily have a causal relationship to the study drug. Severity was rated by the investigator on a scale of mild, moderate and severe, with severe= an AE which prevents normal daily activities. Relation of AE to treatment was determined by the investigator. Serious AEs include death, a life-threatening adverse event, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, OR an important medical event that jeopardized the patient and required medical intervention to prevent the previously listed serious outcomes., Early Start: Day 1 up to 6.5

NCT00879658,"Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy and Optimal Dose Finding Study of BAF312 in Patients With Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00879658,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study was to determine the dose-response curve for the MRI-based efficacy of BAF312 compared with placebo in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), and to characterize its safety and tolerability for the selection of an optimal dose in a later phase III study.

Study Design Rationale An adaptive design was chosen to characterize the dose response curve of BAF312. In a first period of study (""Period 1""), three doses of BAF312 and placebo were tested for MRI efficacy. Based on an interim analysis (IA) after 3 months of treatment, two additional active doses for period 2 wereselected , thus allowing to optimize the overall determination of the dose response curve with 5 data points of active treatment, and placebo. The doses were kept blinded. The use of Modeling and Simulation allowed to establish the full range and dynamics of the dose-response curve in silico, and hence the definition of the optimal dose for later phase III studies.

The choice of placebo as treatment control was essential to obtain information on the specific compared to non-specific effects of active treatment and provides the best way of evaluating the efficacy and of assessing the true safety and tolerability profile of BAF312. Short-term placebo exposure (6 (Period 1) or 3 (Period 2) months, respectively) was unlikely to lead to longer term differences in outcomes \[Polman, 2008\]. The use of an adaptive design strategy contributed to a significant reduction of placebo exposure, both in terms of the number of patients and duration, as compared to conventional trial models.

Patients having completed the study within the protocol might be eligible for the Extension Phase study where they receive long-term BAF312 treatment (a separate protocol).",YES,Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: BAF312|DRUG: Placebo,"Dose Responsiveness of BAF312 Based on the Number of Combined Unique Active MRI Lesions (CUAL), Combined unique active lesions (CUAL) were defined as new gadolinium \[Gd\]-enhanced lesions on T1-weighted MRI scans or new or enlarging lesions on T2-weighted MRI scans, without double-counting of lesions.

The secondary study objectives are to test the superiority of DAC HYP compared to IFN β-1a in slowing functional decline and disability progression and maintaining quality of life in this participant population.",YES,Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,BIOLOGICAL: BIIB019 (Daclizumab High Yield Process)|DRUG: Interferon beta-1a Placebo|BIOLOGICAL: Interferon beta-1a|DRUG: Daclizumab High Yield Process Placebo,"Adjusted Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR), Relapses are defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the examining neurologist. Only relapses confirmed by Independent Neurology Evaluation Committee (INEC) are included in this analysis. Adjusted ARR was estimated from a negative binomial regression model adjusted for the baseline relapse rate, history of prior IFN beta use, baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score (EDSS; ≤ 2.5 vs \> 2.5) and baseline age (≤ 35 vs \> 35 years). Data after participants switched to alternative MS medications are excluded., Up to 144 weeks","Adjusted Mean Number of New or Newly Enlarging T2 Hyperintense Lesions up to Week 96, The quantity of lesions is assessed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The adjusted mean number is estimated from a negative binomial regression model, adjusted for baseline volume of T2 from a negative binomial regression model, adjusted for baseline volume of T2 hyperintense lesions, history of prior IFN beta use and baseline age (≤ 35 vs \> 35 years). To account for the timing of the MRI measurement, the logarithmic transformation of the scan number of the MRI assessment is included in the model as the 'offset' parameter. Observed data after participants switched to alternative MS medications are excluded. Missing data are not imputed. Only observed new or newly enlarging T2 lesions at the last visit of the participant up to Week 96 visit are used in this analysis., up to 96 weeks|Proportion of Participants With Sustained Disability Progression at 144 Weeks, Sustained disability progression is defined as: at least a 1.0-point increase on the EDSS from Baseline EDSS ≥ 1.0 that is sustained for 12 weeks, or at least a 1.5-point increase on the EDSS from baseline EDSS = 0 that is sustained for 12 weeks. The EDSS measures the disability status of people with MS on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating more disability. Estimated proportion of participants with progression is based on the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Participants were censored at the time of withdrawal/switch if they withdrew from study or switched to alternative MS medication without a progression. Participants with a tentative progression at the End of Treatment Period Visit (or the last EDSS assessment prior to alternative MS start date) and no confirmation assessment were censored at their last EDSS assessment., Baseline through 144 weeks|Proportion of Participants Relapse-free at Week 144, Relapses are defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by the examining neurologist.

A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new or worsening of a previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding relapse. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever or infection. The annualized ARR for each treatment group was the mean of the annualized ARRs for all patients in the group calculated as the total number of confirmed relapses divided by the total number of days on study, multiplied by 365.25., Baseline to end of study (Month 24)","Percentage of Patients Free of Disability Progression at Month 24 Assessed With the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) is calculated. Disability progression was determined by the following: One point increase from baseline in patients with baseline EDSS score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase in patients with baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. A 3-month confirmed disability progression required onset EDSS, 3-month confirming EDSS, and all EDSS in between to meet the disability progression criteria.

NCT01144052,Natalizumab De-escalation With Interferon Beta-1b,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01144052,,COMPLETED,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder causing disability in young adults. The management of MS-patients requires treatment with disease-modifying agents, monoclonal antibodies such as natalizumab or immunosuppressants. Natalizumab showed good efficacy and is approved for treatment of relapsing MS with a number of restrictions due to safety issues. Cognitive data related to natalizumab treatment are still scarce. Interferon-beta-1b is approved for high-frequency, subcutaneous (sc) administration in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It reduces the relapse rate, severity, hospitalisation and the disease activity as seen on MRI.

This is a pilot study to explore the concept of de-escalating natalizumab treatment to interferon-beta-1b e.o.d compared to continuous treatment with natalizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis previously treated with natalizumab for 12 months. The study is designed as prospective, controlled, randomized, rater-blinded, parallel-group, two arm, mono-centric including patients of the Ticino Cohort. One arm will be treated with Interferon-beta 1b 250mcg given subcutaneously every other day, the other with Natalizumab 300 mg given intravenously (i.v.), every four weeks. The treatment duration is 12 months, the follow-up period 12 months. The time to first on-study relapse will be compared between the to treatment arms (primary outcome).

There are multiple proposed mechanisms of disorder-related fatigue, however, it is unknown whether PD or MS patients experience compromised blood lactate responses to an acute bout of exercise, subjecting them to exercise-related fatigue. These populations may experience higher energy expenditure at rest due to increased rigidity, however, limited data exists investigating resting energy expenditure in these populations.

Researchers hypothesize that PD and MS patients will display higher resting energy expenditure than healthy age-matched controls, and that level of energy expenditure will correlate with amount of rigidity or spasticity. Also, we hypothesize that baseline levels of lactate will not be different between PD/MS and control groups, but post-exercise blood lactate levels will be significantly higher in the PD/MS groups.",YES,Parkinson's Disease|Multiple Sclerosis,"DEVICE: pro5 AIRdaptive Power Plate (Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands)","Blood Lactate Response, Measured using a blood lactate analyzer, a finger prick test measured before, after, and 10 minutes after exercise, Before, immediately after, and 10 minutes after the squatting exercise protocol","Resting Energy Expenditure, Measured using using indirect calorimetry with a ventilated face mask and noseclip (Parvometrics, Sandy, UT).

NCT00856518,Expiratory Muscle Training for Persons With Neurodegenerative Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00856518,EMST,COMPLETED,"Respiratory difficulty is one of the primary factors leading to death in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple Sclerosis. Both diseases are progressive degenerating diseases that cause difficulties in breathing, airway protection and swallowing. Patients with PD and MS typically become sedentary and lose endurance, maximal fitness levels and overall pulmonary function. Much of the research focus has been on the motor symptoms of PD and MS yet the pulmonary and swallowing complications are perhaps ultimately the most important disability as the diseases progress. The inability to generate adequate respiratory pressure is responsible for reduced cough magnitudes and cough response times. Cough is critical for the clearance of foreign materials in the airway helping to reduce infiltration of bacteria and subsequent respiratory infection. With reduced cough function an increased risk for pulmonary disease occurs due to a reduced ability to protect the airways. There are a number of promising outcomes from an expiratory strength-training program. By increasing expiratory muscle strength and expiratory pressure generation, effective breathing, clearance of the airway, and improved swallowing can occur. These explicit outcomes are predicted based on our experience with the use of an innovative device-driven, home-based expiratory strength training program focused on the expiratory muscles of respiration.

NCT03256851,Telephone-Delivered Exercise for Multiple Sclerosis Fatigue,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03256851,,COMPLETED,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive demyelinating disorder that damages white matter in the central nervous system. Although individuals experience mobility (e.g., walking, balance) impairments that lower quality of life and limit participation in daily activities, one of the most prominent symptoms is fatigue. Up to 92% of individuals report fatigue that manifests as lack of energy, exhaustion or worsening of MS symptoms and ultimately contributes to increasing disability. The currently available pharmaceutical treatments fail to fully control fatigue in the majority of individuals with MS; non-pharmacologic therapies such as exercise and behavioral therapies offer the best hope for combating MS fatigue in the majority of individuals.

Exercise therapy is effective in reducing MS fatigue. However, access to exercise therapy is seriously limited for many individuals with MS due to geographical location, limited resources (e.g., financial, transportation), and/or disability. Thus, the development and evaluation of an alternative delivery method for exercise therapy to target MS-related fatigue that increases participation and reduces barriers is critical.

This study combined all currently ongoing Phase II and III fingolimod extension studies as well as ongoing and newly planned studies into one single long-term extension protocol that provided patients with continuous treatment until fingolimod was registered, commercially available, and reimbursed in the respective countries.",YES,Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Fingolimod,"Parts I and II: Number of Participants With Adverse Events, Serious Adverse Event, and Death, Analysis of absolute and relative frequencies for Adverse Event (AE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Deaths by primary System Organ Class (SOC) to demonstrate that Fingolimod 0.5 mg/day is safe in patients with relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) through the monitoring of relevant clinical and laboratory safety parameters. Only descriptive analysis performed., Baseline (Part I) to Month 6 Follow-up (Part II), up to 8 years","Part I: Aggregate Annualized Relapse Rates (ARR) From First Dose of Fingolimod, Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is defined as the number of all relapses (including both confirmed and unconfirmed relapses) experienced during a specific period of time adjusted to a one-year period. ARR is calculated as follows: (total number of all relapses) / (total number of days in the study for all patients for that specific period of time) x 365.25. Month 0 is the first dose of fingolimod study drug among all studies in which patient participated. Only descriptive analysis performed., Month 0 (Core Baseline) to End of Follow-up Visit (an average of 162 months)|Part I: Number of Participants With Relapses (Confirmed and Unconfirmed) From First Dose of Fingolimod, A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new neurological abnormality or worsening of previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding clinical demyelinating event. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever (\<37.5°C) or infection.

In Study Part One, a relapse must be confirmed by an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) certified Physician within 7 days of the onset of symptoms. A relapse is confirmed when it is accompanied by an increase of at least half a step (0.5) on the EDSS or an increase of 1 point on two different Functional Systems (FS) of the EDSS or 2 points on one of the FS (excluding Bowel/Bladder or Cerebral FS). Month 0 is the first dose of fingolimod study drug among all studies in which patient participated. Only descriptive analysis performed., Month 0 (Core Baseline) to End of Follow-up Visit (an average of 162 months)|Part I: Annualized Rates of New or Newly Enlarging T2 Lesions (ARneT2) Compared With First Dose of Fingolimod, Annualized rate of new/newly enlarging T2 lesions (ARneT2) is defined as the number of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions experienced during a specific period of time adjusted to a one-year period. ARneT2 was calculated as follows: (total number of new/newly enlarging T2 lesions) / (total number of days in the study for all patients for that specific period of time) x 365.25.Month 0 is the first dose of fingolimod study drug among all studies in which patient participated. Only descriptive analysis performed., Month 0 (Core Baseline) to End of Study (an average of Month 156)|Part I: Change From First Dose of Fingolimod in Total T2 Lesions Volume, Total volume of T2 lesions was summarized by presenting descriptive statistics for change from first dose of fingolimod baseline values by visit., Month 3 to End of Study (Study Completion Visit)|Part I: Change From First Dose of Fingolimod in Total T1 Hypointense Lesions Volume, T1 hypointense lesion (black hole) volume was summarized by presenting descriptive statistics for change from first dose of fingolimod baseline values by visit., Month 3 to End of Study (Study Completion Visit)|Part I: Percent Brain Volume Change (PBVC) Relative to First Dose of Fingolimod, Descriptive statistics on percent brain volume change from first dose of fingolimod baseline were presented by visit. A negative change from baseline indicates improvement., Month 3 to Month 156|Part I: Annualized Rate of Brain Atrophy (ARBA) Relative to First Dose of Fingolimod, The annualized rate of brain volume change is an ""averaged annual percentage change"" in brain volume. ARBA was calculated as: ARBA = \[(SIENA/100+1) \^ (365.25/#days)-1\]\*100 where SIENA=(Vk/V0-1)\*100 and Vk is the brain volume at time k, V0 is the brain volume at time 0 and k is the total number of days in the study for all patients for that specific period of time) × 365.25. Only descriptive analysis performed., Month 3 to Month 156|Part I: Number of Participants With Confirmed 6-month Disability Progression After First Dose of Fingolimod, Disability progression was defined based on an increase in the EDSS score by 1.5 point for patients with a first dose of fingolimod (FDF) baseline EDSS score of 0, 1 point for patients with FDF baseline EDSS of \>=1 and \<=5.5, and by 0.5 points for patients with an FDF baseline EDSS\>5.5, confirmed after 6 months and all intermediate EDSS assessments. A 6-month confirmed disability progression was defined as a 6-month sustained increase from the reference (potential onset of progression) value in the EDSS scores. i.e., every EDSS score (scheduled or unscheduled) within a 6-month duration after the first progression should meet the progression criteria as specified above. The confirmation could only happen at a scheduled visit and in the absence of a relapse. Only descriptive analysis performed., Month 12 to Month 156|Part I: Number of Participants With Categorized Change From First Dose of Fingolimod in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Overall Score, The EDSS is a scale for assessing neurological impairment in MS (Kurtzke 1983) including (1) a series of scores in each of eight functional systems, and (2) the EDSS steps (ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS). The functional systems are Visual, Brain Stem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel and Bladder, Cerebral and Other functions. Based on the assessment of each FS, the participant's overall score is categorized as Improvement, Stable or Deterioration.

If baseline EDSS score is \<=5, improvement is indicated by an EDSS score change of \<= -1, stable is indicated by an EDSS score change of \> -1 and \<= 0.5, deterioration is indicated by an EDSS score change of \> 0.5; if baseline EDSS score is \> 5, improvement is indicated by an EDSS score change of \<= -0.5, stable is indicated by an EDSS score change of \> -0.5 and \<= 0, deterioration is indicated by an EDSS score change of \> 0.

NCT02391961,Study and Treatment of Visual Dysfunction and Motor Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02391961,,COMPLETED,"Primary fatigue represents a major cause of disability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), being reported in about 90% of cases. Fatigue interferes with everyday functioning but, unfortunately, little is known about its mechanisms. The investigators propose a characteristic eye movement abnormality (internuclear ophthalmoparesis, INO), commonly encountered in MS, as a simple model for primary motor fatigue. The investigators described worsening of ocular performance in MS patients with INO following visual tasks (ocular motor fatigue), which is likely due to decreased neural conduction along brain pathways injured by MS. This mechanism could represent a major component of MS-related primary motor fatigue. Relevant to Veterans' care, INO is a significant cause of visual disability, especially when complicated by ocular fatigue, and limits daily activities such as reading and driving. The investigators propose a medical treatment to improve ocular performance/fatigue in INO, which can reduce visual disability and improve quality of life in Veterans with MS.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis|Internuclear Ophthalmoplegia|Fatigue,DRUG: Dalfampridine|DRUG: Placebo,"Pulse Size Ratio (PSR): Abducting/Adducting Eye Ratio for Saccadic Peak Velocity., For each saccade made by the subject, the ratio of the maximum velocity (deg/sec) of the eye moving away from the nose and of the eye moving towards the nose was calculated.

Post-Baseline FSS score was the average of Day 57 through 84 values. The analysis was carried out using an ANCOVA model, with the FSS change from Baseline to Days 85 as the dependent variable,, Baseline; Days 57 through 84|Mean Change From Baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Scores at Days 22 and 85, The EDSS, a method of quantifying disability in participants with MS was based on neurological examination of 8 functional systems (FS) (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral, and other) that allowed neurologists to assign a FS score to each of these systems. Neurological findings in each FS were scored on a scale of 0 (low level of problems) to 5 (high level of problems). The ""other"" category was not rated numerically but measured disability related to a particular issue, like motor loss. A total averaged EDSS score was then calculated on a scale of 0 (normal) to 10 (death from MS). The total EDSS score was determined by 2 factors: gait and FS scores. A higher score indicated greater disability. Baseline was defined as last non-missing measurement prior to dosing. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value., Baseline; Days 22 and 85|Mean Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale-29 (MSIS-29) Scores at Day 85, MSIS-29, an instrument measuring the physical (20 items) and psychological (9 items) impact of MS from the participants' perspective was used to evaluate therapeutic effectiveness from the participants' perspective. Participants were asked to circle the response that best described the impact of MS on daily life on a scale of 0 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). The total MSIS-29 score ranged from 0 to 145, was calculated as the sum of the sub-scores for all 29 questions, with lower scores indicating better quality of life. Baseline was defined as last non-missing measurement prior to dosing. Change from Baseline was calculated as the post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value.

NCT03418376,Carnosine Loading and Periodized Training in MS and HC,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03418376,,COMPLETED,"Increasing evidence favours exercise therapy as an efficient tool to counteract inactivity related secondary symptoms in MS. Furthermore, exercise therapy may affect MS-associated muscle contractile and energy supply dysfunctions. So far, low to moderate intensity exercise rehabilitation has shown to induce small but consistent improvements in several functional parameters. High intensity exercise training in MS seems to further improve this. However, although results are promising, impairments in both muscle contraction and energy supply probably attenuate therapy outcome. In keeping with the above described physiological role of skeletal muscle carnosine and because muscle carnosine content may be lower in MS, the primary aim of the present project is to investigate whether carnosine loading improves exercise therapy outcome (exercise capacity, body composition) and performance in MS. If the latter hypothesis can be confirmed, muscle carnosine loading could be a novel intervention to improve exercise capacity and muscle function in this population.",YES,Multiple Sclerosis|Exercise Therapy|Dietary Supplement,DIETARY_SUPPLEMENT: Beta-alanine supplementation|OTHER: Exercise intervention,"VO2max, Exercise capacity will be assessed using a maximal (12-lead ECG) graded cardiopulmonary exercise test (♂: 30W+15W/min, ♀: 20W+10W/min, GE eBike Basic®) with pulmonary gas exchange analysis (Jaeger Oxycon®).

NCT01600716,Safety and Efficacy Study of OnabotulinumtoxinA for the Treatment of Urinary Incontinence Due to Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) in Non-Catheterizing Patients With Multiple Sclerosis (MS),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01600716,,COMPLETED,This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of OnabotulinumtoxinA (BOTOX®) for the treatment of urinary incontinence due to NDO in non-catheterizing patients with MS.,YES,Urinary Incontinence|Multiple Sclerosis|Neurogenic Bladder,BIOLOGICAL: OnabotulinumtoxinA|DRUG: Placebo (Normal Saline),"Change From Baseline in Daily Average Frequency of Urinary Incontinence Episodes, Incontinence is defined as involuntary loss of urine as recorded in a patient bladder diary. The number of episodes of urinary incontinence is recorded over a 3-day period the week of the study visit. A negative number change from baseline indicates a reduction in incontinence episodes (improvement) and a positive number change indicates an increase in incontinence episodes (worsening)., Baseline, Week 6","Change From Baseline in Maximum Cystometric Capacity (MCC), MCC represents the maximum volume of urine the bladder holds. A positive number change from baseline represents an improvement (increase) in the maximum volume of urine the bladder holds and a negative number change from baseline represents a worsening (decrease) in the maximum volume of urine the bladder holds., Baseline, Week 6|Change From Baseline in Maximum Detrusor Pressure During the First Involuntary Detrusor Contraction (IDC), Maximum detrusor pressure represents the maximum pressure (peak amplitude) in the bladder during the first involuntary contraction of the bladder muscle.

NCT02048072,Evaluation of the Autonomic Nervous System During First-dosing With 0.5mg of Fingolimod (Gilenya) in Patients With Relapsing-remitting MS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02048072,ANSG,COMPLETED,"This study is designed to primarily evaluate the impact of Gilenya (Fingolimod) on the autonomic nervous system in patients being treated for the first time with Gilenya (Fingolimod). Effects on the cardiovascular system will be studied as well. The study is conducted to answer the question, if, and if yes, what impact the treatment with Gilenya (Fingolimod) has on the autonomic nervous system. To our knowledge little is known about the effects of Gilenya (Fingolimod) on the autonomic nervous system. We do know of rare, but potentially clinically and therapeutically relevant cardiovascular adverse events of Gilenya (Fingolimod). From a scientific point of view the mechanisms by which this is mediated are of interest. Maybe a better understanding of these mechanisms might even be of clinical relevance (e.g. risk stratification).

The impact of Gilenya (Fingolimod) on the autonomic nervous system is quantitavely measured, using a state-of-the-art technique. Non-invasive blood pressure measurement is performed with the Finometer Pro (Finapres Medical Systems, NL) under different paradigms (breathing at rest, deep breath, valsalva maneuver, active standing). In addition the sympathetic skin reaction is performed. The non-invasive blood pressure measurements are done by continuous, plethysmographic blood pressure measurement at the index finger, while the patient is performing the tasks mentioned above. By interpreting the blood pressure curve, heart rate and blood pressure variability are calculated. The sympathetic skin reaction consists of measuring the change of electric conductibility of the skin (palms and soles) after an electric stimulus of a peripheral nerve. These parameters allow to assess the functionality of four important autonomic functional systems (orthostasis, sympathetic adrenergic, sympathetic cholinergic, parasympathetic cholinergic). Normative data has been acquired in our lab.

Our hypothethis is, that there will be a change of heart rate variability at t4,5h compared to baseline (t0) for the parameter ""RMSSD"" under ""normal breathing"".",YES,Multiple Sclerosis|Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction,DRUG: Gilenya,"RMSSD Normal Breathing, Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) is one of a few time-domain tools used to assess heart rate variability, the successive differences being neighboring RR or pulse intervals.

It is calculated as the square root of the mean of the squares of the successive differences between adjacent RR intervals or pulse intervals.

In this study pulse intervals were measured non-invasively during five minutes, while subjects were supine, breathing regularly.

Measurements were done at two timepoints t=0 and t=4,5hours.

Many people with a brain injury or neurological disorders experience difficulty in swallowing. Past studies have shown that an electrical pulse applied to muscles or an increase in sensory stimulation to the throat can help.

Patients ages 18 to 90 who have had a brain injury or neurological disorder and who have had trouble swallowing for 6 months or longer may be eligible for this study. Patients will undergo a physical examination, pregnancy test, and exam by a throat and speech physician. Fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing with sensory testing involves a flexible tube passed through the nose to the back of the throat to allow observation of the voice box. Videofluoroscopy, an X-ray of the head and neck, will be done while patients swallow. Patients experiencing trouble with the upper esophagus may undergo additional procedures, including manometry to measure pressure changes in the back of the throat, and reevaluation through the fiber-optic tube. Patients in this study will have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which uses a strong magnetic field to obtain images of the body. Patients will lie on a table that slides into the enclosed tunnel of the scanner. The scan will take 20 to 25 minutes.

Patients will be assigned randomly to one of two groups: the intramuscular group, to have a stimulation device implanted in the neck, and the vibrotactile group, to receive a vibrotactile stimulator. All patients will have 10 training sessions with their devices, plus follow-up. Those patients in the first group will undergo surgery, under general anesthesia, for the implant. Three weeks following the implant procedure, patients will come to NIH to have the stimulator turned on and programmed and to learn how to use the device. Those patients in the second group will have about 2 to 3 weeks of training in using a vibrotactile device, and then they will take it home to use. All patients will return to NIH at 3 months to ensure proper use of the devices, and they will visit for follow-up at 6 months and 12 months for tests and questionnaires.

NCT01289912,Trial of RAD001 and Neurocognition in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC),https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01289912,TSC,COMPLETED,"Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a multi-system disease, usually presenting with seizures, mental retardation and autism, and exhibiting a high variability in clinical findings both among and within families. Investigators are doing research in order to identify possible neurocognitive benefits from treatment with RAD001 or placebo for a six month period. There may also be potential for improvements in seizure frequency, sleep and autistic behaviors. We hope this trial will lead to a better understanding of TSC and to new forms of treatment, to benefit children and adults with TSC in the future.

Individuals diagnosed with TSC will be asked to participate in this study if they are between the ages of 6 and 21 years of age and have an IQ of greater than or equal to 60. Both males and females will be asked to participate. Additionally, to be eligible for study participation, individuals must have been on the same seizure medication(s), if applicable, for at least 6 months. Individuals must also be able to participate in neuropsychological testing and meet certain medical criteria. They will need to sign an informed consent. If enrolled in the study, participants will have a number of screening tests to help determine if they are eligible for participation in the clinical trial. If eligible for the treatment phase of the trial, they will be asked to take either the study drug or a placebo (pill with no medicine), which is determined by chance.

The study involves about 9 visits, 3 of which can be done locally, over a six month period, as well as follow-up calls with our research nurse. Study visits will vary in length. Screening, three month and six month visits may last up to 8 hours, while all other visits will be less than 2 hours. The study visits include blood draws, laboratory tests and neuropsychological assessments. There is no fee to participate in this study. The study drug will be provided at no charge during the study.

Thus, the development of practical, inexpensive, and effective adjunct treatments is needed.

The study is to examine the efficacy of different tDCS protocols at improving walking in PwMS. Although the details of the studies slightly vary, the global aspects of the experimental procedures are identical with the exception that the tDCS stimulation parameter timing differs between the groups. The study will be double-blind, sham-controlled, randomized cross-over design.

Maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs) of the right and left knee extensors, knee flexors, hip flexors, and dorsiflexors will be performed to determine the more-affected leg.

NCT03051646,Aspirin as a Pre-Treatment for Exercise in Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03051646,,COMPLETED,"Exercise has many benefits for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), such as improved physical symptoms, mood, fatigue, and cognition. However, many people with MS refrain from exercising because of the discomfort of exhaustion and overheating that they experience. This study investigates the use of aspirin before exercise as a treatment to reduce overheating and exhaustion, thereby availing many more people with MS the opportunity to benefit from exercise.

The investigators recently published the first-ever report of elevated body temperature in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients relative to healthy controls, and elevated temperature was linked to worse fatigue. This finding that body temperature is elevated and linked to fatigue in RRMS lays the groundwork for a paradigm shift in our understanding and treatment of fatigue. That is, the focus shifts from exogenous to endogenous temperature, and from stimulant medication to cooling treatments.

A recent study comparing healthy adults to adults with MS showed that whereas exercise increased body temperature in both groups, only in the MS group was it correlated with exhaustion. The reason for this may relate to the elevation in resting body temperature in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients relative to healthy controls. The finding is clinically meaningful, as elevated body temperature was correlated with worse fatigue in patients. Exercise Aim: To determine whether pretreatment with ASA (compared to placebo: within subject crossover design) before exercise results in improved exercise performance (i.e., increased time-to-exhaustion). The investigators hypothesize that participants will tolerate exercise for longer after taking ASA than placebo. This hypothesis is based on a) demonstrated efficacy of antipyretic for reducing body temperature during exercise in healthy controls, b) demonstrated efficacy of antipyretic for reducing fatigue in non-exercising MS patients, and c) demonstrated efficacy of elaborate (unblinded) cooling treatments (e.g., cooling garments, cooling hand chamber) for improving exercise performance in MS patients. Note that this project is especially important for MS patients, who have a disease-specific body temperature elevation and sensitivity to heat (i.e., Uhthoff's).",YES,Fatigue|Overheating,"DRUG: Acetylsalicylic acid at 1st visit, then Placebo at 2nd visit|DRUG: Placebo at 1st visit, then Acetylsalicylic acid at 2nd visit","Change in Time to Exhaustion, The measure of interest is the length of time (in seconds) spent exercising at each session.

However, please note that healthy adults' time to exhaustion is approximately 12 minutes., ASA's effect will be assessed from date of randomization until cessation of exercise test at each of two study visits to be completed within a 14-day period.","Exercise-induced Body Temperature Increase, Measure of interest is increase in body temperature from pre- to post-exercise test in each treatment condition (ASA vs. placebo), Effect of treatment on body temperature in a single session (i.e., pre- to post- exercise test) to be completed within a 14-day period",,Columbia University,National Multiple Sclerosis Society,ALL,ADULT,EARLY_PHASE1,12,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",AAAQ1758,2017-01-13,2017-05-10,2017-05-10,2017-02-14,2018-11-20,2018-11-20,"Columbia University Medical Center, MS Center, New York, New York, 10032, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/46/NCT03051646/Prot_SAP_000.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/46/NCT03051646/ICF_001.pdf"

An additional objective is to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two different doses of AVP-923 in a subset of the study population.

Pseudobulbar Affect (PBA) is a condition characterized by involuntary, sudden and frequent episodes of laughing and/or crying out of proportion or incongruous to the underlying emotion of happiness or sadness Other terms used to describe this condition include emotional lability, emotionalism, emotional incontinence, emotional discontrol, excessive emotionalism, and pathological laughing and crying. The outbursts can occur spontaneously or in response to provocative stimuli such as questions or events.

A body of evidence suggests that PBA can be modulated through pharmacologic intervention.

Dextromethorphan (DM) is a low-affinity uncompetitive antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, reducing the level of excitatory activity. DM also acts at the phencyclidine-binding site, which is part of the NMDA receptor complex. DM is a sigma receptor agonist, suppressing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters.

NCT02451696,A Pilot Study To Evaluate The Effects of Everolimus on Brain mTOR Activity and Cortical Hyperexcitability in TSC and FCD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02451696,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to measure if the drug called Everolimus effects mTOR signaling (an electrical activity signal in the brain) in patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) and Focal Cortical Dysplasia (FCD) with treatment resistant epilepsy (TRE) who will be undergoing brain surgery. One group of patients will be treated with Everolimus, and another will not. Researchers will determine if there is a difference in mTOR signaling between the patients who were treated with Everolimus and those who were not. Previous studies have suggested that Everolimus may reduce seizure activity in TSC patients by decreasing mTOR signaling. Since patients with FCD may also have excess mTOR signaling brain activity, Everolimus may also reduce seizure activity in these patients.

The drug Everolimus is approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat specific types of breast, pancreatic, and kidney cancer, a kidney tumor called an angiomyolipoma (common in patients with TSC), and TSC patients who have a brain tumor called a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA).

Stem cells are collected from the patient's blood and stored prior to treatment. To store the stem cells patients are given colony-stimulating factors, such as filgrastim (G-CSF) or chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide) to help stem cells move from the bone marrow to the blood so they can be collected and stored. After storage, patients are then given high-dose chemotherapy, cyclophosphamide, and immunosuppression with anti-thymocyte globulin to suppress the immune system to prepare for the transplant.

This multi-site trial will (1) test the driving decision aid (DDA) in improving decision making and quality (knowledge, decision conflict, values concordance and behavior intent); and (2) determine its effects on specific subpopulations of older drivers (stratified for cognitive function, decisional capacity, and attitudinally readiness for a mobility transition). The overarching hypotheses are that the DDA will help older adults make high-quality decisions, which will mitigate the negative psychosocial impacts of driving reduction, and that optimal DDA use will target certain populations and settings.",YES,Diabetic Retinopathy|Macular Degeneration|Glaucoma|Retinitis Pigmentosa|Vision Disorders|Acute Coronary Syndrome|Implantable Defibrillator User|Congestive Heart Failure|Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy|Orthostatic Hypotension|Syncope|Presyncope|Narcolepsy|Dementia|Multiple Sclerosis|Parkinson Disease|Brain Injuries|Spinal Cord Injuries|Stroke|Vertigo|Dizziness|Seizures|Substance Use|Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus|Arthritis|Foot--Abnormalities|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|Obstructive Sleep Apnea|End Stage Renal Disease|Sleep Apnea|Insomnia|Restless Legs Syndrome,BEHAVIORAL: Driving Decision Aid|BEHAVIORAL: Older Drivers Website,"Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) Scores at Day 0 (Post-intervention), Decision conflict scale (DCS) is calculated from 16 items, with each item ranging from 0 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). The total score is reported on a 0-100 scale by summing all responses, dividing by 16 and multiplying by 25. Higher scores represent greater levels of uncertainty in decision-making (higher decision conflict = worse outcome), and interventions often aim to reduce decision conflict (lower decision conflict = greater likelihood of implementing a decision = better outcome)., Day 0 (Post-intervention)","Values Clarity Subscale Score at Day 0 (Post-intervention), For the values clarity subscale, three decision conflict scale (DCS) items (Likert scale responses from 0 \['strongly agree'\] to 4 \['strongly disagree'\]) are summed, divided by 3 and multiplied by 25; scores range from 0 (extremely clear) to 100 (extremely unclear about personal values); lower scores represent higher values clarity, which is a better outcome. Lower values clarity subscale scores are associated with positive outcomes. The measure will be assessed in drivers immediately following administration of control condition or intervention., Day 0 (Post-intervention)|Older Adult Driving Safety Knowledge Scores as Assessed by True/False Questions at Day 0 (Post-intervention), The following true/false questions will be used to examine participants' safe driving knowledge: 1) Older drivers pose a bigger risk to other drivers and pedestrians than younger drivers do; 2) Drivers aged 70 years and older are more likely to be hurt or killed if they are in a crash; 3) There is a milestone age when everyone should stop driving; 4) With age, a person needs more light to see well; 5) Getting lost on familiar roads is a sign that it might be time to stop driving. A higher number of correctly answered questions indicate better outcomes. Knowledge will be defined as the percentage of correct scores of the 5 questions (ranging from 0% \[worst outcome\] to 100% \[best outcome\]). The measure will be assessed in drivers immediately following administration of control condition or intervention., Day 0 (Post-intervention)|Decision Self Efficacy Score at Day 0 (Post-intervention), The Decision Self-Efficacy Scale will be used to assess decision self efficacy. Scores range from 0 (extremely low self-efficacy; worst outcome) to 100 (extremely high self-efficacy; best outcome). Higher scores indicate better outcomes. The measure will be assessed in drivers immediately following administration of control condition or intervention, Day 0 (Post-intervention)|Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 4-item Depression Score, Depression will be measured using the PROMIS Short Form 4-item scale (4a Adult v1.0), with higher PROMIS scores indicating higher depression. PROMIS scores are presented as standardized T-scores (mean=50, standard deviation=10). Lower PROMIS depression scores indicate better outcomes (lower depression).

Change in depression is calculated as the PROMIS depression score at each time point (6, 12, 18, or 24 months) minus the score at baseline (pre-randomization). Since PROMIS scores at each time point can range from 41.0 to 79.4, change in depression PROMIS scores can range from -38.4 to +38.4. Change-scores \> 0 represent increases in depression (poor outcome), and changes \<= 0 represent maintained or decreased depression (better outcome)., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Ottawa Decision Regret Score, Change in decision regret will be measured by the Ottawa Decision Regret Scale. This validated measure correlates with decision satisfaction and conflict, and overall quality of life. Scored from 0-100, high scores represent higher regret. Lower scores indicate better outcomes.

Decision regret was measured at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, so change in decision regret can be calculated from 12 months (vs. 6 months), 18 months (vs. 6 months), and 24 months (vs 6 months). Since decision regret scores range from 0-100, change in decision regret scores range from -100 to + 100, with change-scores \<= 0 representing maintenance or decreases in decision regret (positive outcome) and change-scores \> 0 representing increased decision regret over time (negative outcome)., 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Life Space Score, Life space is a global measure of mobility and community engagement. The Life-Space Assessment instrument (UAB Study of Aging) is a validated tool assessing recent mobility and function. Composite scores range from 0 (bedbound) to 120 (travel out of town every day without assistance); scores of ≤60 are correlated with lower levels of social participation and higher mortality. Higher scores indicate better outcomes.

Change in life space can be calculated at 6 months (vs baseline), 12 months (vs baseline), 18 months (vs baseline), and 24 months (vs baseline). Since life space scores range from 0-120, change-scores in life space can range from -120 to +120. Maintained or increased life space (change-scores \>= 0) are positive outcomes, and decreased life space (change-scores \< 0) are negative outcomes., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Self-reported Driving Frequency, Self-reported driving frequency will be measured by number of days per week participants drive, with consideration of higher or lower frequency as a positive or negative outcome in the context of participant's intent to drive with lower or higher frequency.

In the final study survey, this question was reworded, so participants were asked ""during the past 6 months, have you reduced the number of days per week you normally drive?"" with response options of ""yes"", ""no"", ""I don't know"". Percentage of those who answered ""yes"" at each time point are reported., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Change in Self-reported Situational Driving Avoidance, Driving avoidance in certain situations will be measured by asking participants about their avoidance of riskier driving situations, e.g., nighttime driving, with consideration of avoidance in certain situations as a positive or negative outcome in the context of participant's intent to avoid these situations.

Avoidance of night driving was worded as: ""Using a scale from 1 to 7 where 1 is Not At All Comfortable and 7 is Completely Comfortable, how comfortable do you feel in the following situation?"", and the situation presented was ""Driving at night?"". Higher scores indicate greater comfort with driving at night, and lower scores represent less comfort. Therefore, change-scores can range from -6 to + 6, with change-scores \>= 0 indicate maintained or increased comfort with driving at night, and change-scores \< 0 indicate reduced comfort in driving at night., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Occurrence of Driving Cessation, Driving cessation will be measured by asking participants whether they are currently driving; all participants were currently driving at study baseline. Consideration of driving cessation as a positive or negative outcome will be determined in the context of participant's intent to engage in driving cessation. This question was worded as ""Do you currently drive?"" with response options of ""yes"" and ""no"". The numbers reported are those who said ""no"", which represents driving cessation.

The wording of this question was added to the study after an early DSMB meeting, so less data are available for it at earlier time points., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months|Occurrence of Self-reported Crashes, Occurrence of self-reported crashes will be measured by ≥1 crash versus no crashes, where ≥1 crash is a negative outcome., 6 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months",,"University of Colorado, Denver",National Institute on Aging (NIA),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,529,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (OUTCOMES_ASSESSOR)|Primary Purpose: HEALTH_SERVICES_RESEARCH,19-0059|R01AG059613,2019-12-12,2023-06-23,2023-12-21,2019-10-28,2025-02-21,2025-02-21,"University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|CU Anschutz Medical Center, Aurora, Colorado, 80045, United States|Indiana University, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46202, United States","Study Protocol and Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/91/NCT04141891/Prot_SAP_000.pdf"
