NCT00604591,Effects of Tolcapone on Frontotemporal Dementia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00604591,,COMPLETED,"This study will test the effects of a medication called tolcapone on cognitive, behavioral, and language problems seen in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Tolcapone increases the amount of dopamine, a brain chemical that may be lowered in FTD. The study will see if tolcapone can improve thinking, behavior, and language in people with FTD and will look at the effects of the drug on brain activity.

Patients with FTD who are between 40 and 85 years of age may be eligible for this study.

Participants will be seen as outpatients at the Columbia University Medical Center approximately one a week for 4 weeks. They take tolcapone or a placebo (a look-alike pill with no active ingredient) during study week 1. During study week 3, those who took placebo during week 1 now take tolcapone for 1 week and those who took tolcapone now take placebo. In addition, patients undergo the following tests and procedures:

* Neurological tests to evaluate attention, problem-solving and memory. These tests are repeated several times during the course of the study.
* Test to look for a gene that affects the amount of dopamine in the brain, using blood samples collected in a previous study.
* Blood draws four times during the study.
* Functional MRI (fMRI) to learn about changes in brain regions that are involved in performing tasks. For fMRI, the patient lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner, a narrow metal cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field. The procedure takes about 60 minutes and is performed four times over the course of the .

The NPI assesses 12 behavioral domains on the dimensions of frequency and severity. Frequency is rated on a scale where 0 = absent, 1 = occasionally, 2 = often, 3 = frequently, 4 = very frequently. Severity is rated on a scale where 0 = absent, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe. For each of the domains, 3 scores are obtained: frequency, severity, and total (product of frequency and severity; ranges from 0 to 12, with a lower score desirable). A total NPI score can be calculated by summing the domain total scores.

NCT02191267,Tau Imaging of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02191267,,COMPLETED,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative brain disease with symptoms that include memory loss, problems with impulse control, and depression that can lead to suicide. As the disease progresses, it can lead to dementia. Currently CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem where an over-accumulation of a protein called tau is observed. There is now a new experimental measure that makes it possible, for the first time, to measure tau protein in the living human brain using a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, \[F-18\] AV-1451 (aka, \[18F\]-T807).

The main objective of this study is to use a novel PET approach to measure tau accumulation in the brain. The presence of CTE at autopsy in deceased National Football League (NFL) players has been well documented. Accordingly, we will conduct this study in a group of retired NFL players who have clinical symptoms of CTE and are suspected of having CTE based on high levels of tau in their spinal fluid and abnormalities seen on research brain scans. We will compare them with a control group of former elite level athletes who have not experienced any brain trauma, deny any clinical symptoms, and who have completely normal spinal fluid tau and amyloid levels, and brain scans. We will also include a group of subjects with AD. All participants will be recruited from ongoing studies, headed by the Partnering PI of this proposal, Dr. Robert Stern, at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy and the Alzheimer's Disease Center. We will use both a beta amyloid PET scan (\[18F\]-florbetapir) and a tau PET scan (\[18F\]-T807) on consecutive days. With the beta amyloid scan we expect little or no evidence of amyloid in the NFL players with presumed CTE, and no evidence of amyloid in the control group of athletes with no history of repetitive brain trauma. In contrast we expect to see beta amyloid accumulation in the AD patient brains. With the new tau ligand, we expect that the NFL players with presumed CTE will show elevated levels of tau protein in the brain, which will not be observed in athletes without a history of brain trauma, but which will be seen in the AD patients' brains.

Another goal is to use the latest MRI technologies to develop specific tau imaging biomarkers that correlate with the PET and spinal fluid tau measures but without the radiation of PET or invasiveness of spinal taps. The development of these surrogate imaging markers of tau, is critically important to diagnosing CTE. This in turn will lead to studies relevant to treatment and prevention of this devastating disease. Finally, as an exploratory method of examining possible genetic risk for CTE, we will also use cutting edge genetic analysis of blood samples from subjects in this proposal and compare tau load, measured by PET tau ligand uptake and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau level, with a measure of genetic susceptibility to tau load, referred to as the genetic risk score for tau.",YES,Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,RADIATION: [F18]-T807|RADIATION: [F18]-Florbetapir|DEVICE: MRI/MRS|GENETIC: Genetic Analysis for Genetic Risk Score for Tau.,"Tau Protein Uptake.., Whole brain mean (and standard deviation) cortical value derived from standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr).

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.
