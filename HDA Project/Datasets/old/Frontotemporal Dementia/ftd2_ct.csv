FTD may present with focal language symptoms that are clinically described as primary progressive aphasia (PPA). There are two types of PPA associated with FTD-semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (SV-PPA) and nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (NFV-PPA). Both diseases are progressive neurodegenerative disease processes that compromise dominant hemisphere large scale brain network function, ultimately resulting in mutism. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for PPA and management is mostly supportive. In combination with resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) offers a non-invasive alternative to pharmacotherapy in persons with PPA. In our prior studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Lewy body Dementia (LBD) subjects, investigators have determined that the anterior temporal pole (area TGd and TGv) is an area that is commonly dysfunctional in dementia. The investigators have already embarked upon an fMRI guided study of iTBS in early stage Alzheimer's disease where subjects received a series of 5 treatments to distinct brain regions inclusive of area TGd.

NCT00975689,"Biomarker Validation for Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C: Safety and Efficacy of N-Acetyl Cysteine",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00975689,,COMPLETED,"Background:

* Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) is a genetic disorder that results in progressive loss of nervous system function by affecting the membranes of nerve cells. There is no known cure for NPC.
* N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a drug that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration to use either orally or IV for the treatment of acetaminophen (Tylenol) poisoning or as an aerosol to reduce the stickiness of mucous in patients with cystic fibrosis. In the body, NAC is converted to an amino acid called cysteine, which cells can convert to a chemical called glutathione. Glutathione is important in helping cells deal with oxidative stress. Based on a number of experiments in cells, mice and patients with NPC, we believe that oxidative stress is increased in NPC. If we can increase glutathione levels, we may be able to decrease the oxidative stress.

Objectives:

\- To test the safety and effectiveness of N-acetyl cysteine to treat Niemann-Pick disease (type C).

Eligibility:

\- Individuals at least 1 year of age who have been diagnosed with NPC.

Design:

* Patients entering this study will be seen at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center four times during the 20 weeks of the study. These admissions will occur at the start of the study and at weeks 8, 12, and 20. The first NIH visit will last 2 days, and the other visits will last 1 day.
* Patients will participate in a two-stage study: a period of 8 weeks receiving NAC and a second period of 8 weeks when receiving a placebo (a pill without NAC). Every patient participating in this study will receive NAC during one of the two time periods.
* The two treatment periods will be separated by a wash-out period, 4 weeks when patients will receive neither NAC nor placebo. Patients will also have a 4-week wash-out period at the beginning of the study. Most physician-prescribed medications, such as seizure medications, will be allowed.
* During each visit, examinations, procedures, and tests will be done, including blood and urine samples.",YES,"Niemann-Pick Disease, Type C",DRUG: N-Acetyl Cysteine,"Oxysterol Levels, Six months",,,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD),University of Oxford|Washington University School of Medicine|National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI),ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE1|PHASE2,35,NIH,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: CROSSOVER|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",090185|09-CH-0185,2009-08,2010-11,2010-11,2009-09-11,2012-07-12,2013-05-06,"National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892, United States",

NCT02606422,tDCS Intervention in Primary Progressive Aphasia,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02606422,,COMPLETED,"Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects first and foremost language abilities. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is slowly progressive decline in a single domain of cognition (e.g. language) not attributable to motor or sensory loss, without impediment of social or occupational function. MCI can be an early sign of neurodegenerative disease, or can be due to normal aging. When language is the prominent affected domain in MCI, the person may later meet criteria for PPA or may progress to the clinical syndrome of Alzheimer's dementia. Spelling, naming, and working memory (e.g. repetition) are among the language abilities affected early in the course of PPA or language-centered MCI, and different variants have distinct deficits in these domains. This research project investigates the behavioral and neuromodulatory effects of high definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) during language therapy in PPA participants over time. Anodal HD-tDCS targeting the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) administered in combination with language therapy is expected to be more beneficial when compared to language therapy alone. It will 1) improve language performance or decrease rate of decline, 2) have better-sustained effects at 2 weeks and 2 months post-treatment, and 3) produce generalization to untrained language items and some other cognitive functions. Resting-state fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and volumetric data are also collected to investigate changes in functional brain connectivity associated with HD-tDCS in individuals with PPA. A better understanding of the therapeutic and neuromodulatory mechanisms of HD-tDCS as an adjunct to language therapy in PPA may have a significant impact on the development of effective therapies for PPA and MCI, and may offer insight into ways of impeding neurodegeneration that may improve patients' quality of life, as well as extend their ability to work and manage their affairs.",YES,Primary Progressive Aphasia|MCI|FTD,DEVICE: Active HD-tDCS plus Speech-Language Therapy|DEVICE: Sham plus Speech-Language Therapy,"Absolute Percent Change in Written Naming (Trained Items), The primary outcome measure was the absolute percentage change in the number of correct letters in the written response, compared to the target response in the trained word lists. This calculation reflects the change in accuracy between two timepoints.

For letter accuracy scoring, a rule-based system was used where each letter was assigned one point if correct. Points were deducted for errors such as deletions, additions, substitutions, transpositions, or movements of letters. A second reviewer independently scored the responses and resolved any discrepancies through discussion to ensure consensus. Interrater reliability for letter accuracy scoring was 95%.

Average letter accuracy per word was calculated for all trained items. Then the absolute percentage change was calculated by subtracting the earlier time point value (e.g., baseline) from the later one (e.g., immediately after treatment, 2 weeks post, and 2 months post), reflecting the change in accuracy., Change from Baseline to Immediately after treatment (3 weeks), 2 weeks post treatment (5 weeks), and 2 months post-treatment (11 weeks) for each period of intervention|Absolute Percent Change in Written Naming (Untrained Items), The primary outcome measure was the absolute percentage change in the number of correct letters in the written response, compared to the target response in the untrained word lists.This calculation reflects the change in accuracy between two timepoints.

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.

NCT02191267,Tau Imaging of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02191267,,COMPLETED,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative brain disease with symptoms that include memory loss, problems with impulse control, and depression that can lead to suicide. As the disease progresses, it can lead to dementia. Currently CTE can only be diagnosed postmortem where an over-accumulation of a protein called tau is observed. There is now a new experimental measure that makes it possible, for the first time, to measure tau protein in the living human brain using a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, \[F-18\] AV-1451 (aka, \[18F\]-T807).

The main objective of this study is to use a novel PET approach to measure tau accumulation in the brain. The presence of CTE at autopsy in deceased National Football League (NFL) players has been well documented. Accordingly, we will conduct this study in a group of retired NFL players who have clinical symptoms of CTE and are suspected of having CTE based on high levels of tau in their spinal fluid and abnormalities seen on research brain scans. We will compare them with a control group of former elite level athletes who have not experienced any brain trauma, deny any clinical symptoms, and who have completely normal spinal fluid tau and amyloid levels, and brain scans. We will also include a group of subjects with AD. All participants will be recruited from ongoing studies, headed by the Partnering PI of this proposal, Dr. Robert Stern, at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy and the Alzheimer's Disease Center. We will use both a beta amyloid PET scan (\[18F\]-florbetapir) and a tau PET scan (\[18F\]-T807) on consecutive days. With the beta amyloid scan we expect little or no evidence of amyloid in the NFL players with presumed CTE, and no evidence of amyloid in the control group of athletes with no history of repetitive brain trauma. In contrast we expect to see beta amyloid accumulation in the AD patient brains. With the new tau ligand, we expect that the NFL players with presumed CTE will show elevated levels of tau protein in the brain, which will not be observed in athletes without a history of brain trauma, but which will be seen in the AD patients' brains.

Another goal is to use the latest MRI technologies to develop specific tau imaging biomarkers that correlate with the PET and spinal fluid tau measures but without the radiation of PET or invasiveness of spinal taps. The development of these surrogate imaging markers of tau, is critically important to diagnosing CTE. This in turn will lead to studies relevant to treatment and prevention of this devastating disease. Finally, as an exploratory method of examining possible genetic risk for CTE, we will also use cutting edge genetic analysis of blood samples from subjects in this proposal and compare tau load, measured by PET tau ligand uptake and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau level, with a measure of genetic susceptibility to tau load, referred to as the genetic risk score for tau.",YES,Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,RADIATION: [F18]-T807|RADIATION: [F18]-Florbetapir|DEVICE: MRI/MRS|GENETIC: Genetic Analysis for Genetic Risk Score for Tau.,"Tau Protein Uptake.., Whole brain mean (and standard deviation) cortical value derived from standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr).
