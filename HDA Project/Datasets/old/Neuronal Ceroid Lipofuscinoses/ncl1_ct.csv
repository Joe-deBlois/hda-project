This tool was developed to document by rating motor, language, and visual functions in participants with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2) Batten disease, and to collect their incidence of grand mal seizures. To assess disease progression and evaluate efficacy, the combined score of the motor and language domains of the Hamburg scale was used. Each domain was scored from 0 (no function) to 3 (normal function) for a maximal possible score of 6 for the combined score, referred to as the Hamburg Motor + Language aggregate score.

A higher UBDRS subscale score indicated greater physical impairment, with zero indicating a better outcome. Subscales included Physical Assessment (range 0-84), Seizure Assessment (range 0-54), Behavioral Assessment (range 0-55) and Capability Assessment of Actual Vision and Normal Vision (range 0-14).

Standard scores between 85 and 115 are considered to be within normal limits. Total scores are the sum of standard scores for auditory comprehension and expressive communication, which is then converted to a total standard score using PLS-5 Appendix B. Age-equivalent scores in each area were summarized by study visit with descriptive statistics. Higher scores represent better language development and lower scores reflect a possible language delay or disorder.

NCT00028262,Cystagon to Treat Infantile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00028262,,COMPLETED,"This study will examine the effectiveness of a drug called Cystagon in treating infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL), a progressive neurological disease affecting children. At around 11 to 13 months of age, patients develop slowed head growth, mild brain atrophy (wasting), electroencephalographic (EEG) changes and retinal deterioration, with symptoms worsening over time. The disease results from an enzyme deficiency that causes fatty compounds called ceroid to accumulate in cells. In laboratory experiments, Cystagon has helped remove ceroid from cells of patients with INCL.

Children with INCL between 6 months and 3 years of age may be eligible for this study. Participants take Cystagon daily by mouth every 6 hours. They are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for a 4- to 5-day period every 6 months for the following tests and evaluations:

* Review of medical history, including a detailed record of seizures, physical examination, blood tests and clinical photographs. For the initial baseline studies, examinations may also be scheduled with pediatric neurology, ophthalmology and anesthesia services.
* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain MRI uses a powerful magnet, radio waves, and computers to provide detailed images of the brain without the use of X-rays. The patient lies on a table that slides inside a donut-shaped machine containing a magnetic field. The child requires general anesthesia for the procedure.
* Electroretinogram (ERG) measures the function of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. To record the flash ERG, a special contact lens is placed on the eye s surface and the eye is stimulated with flashes of light. Infants and very young children require general anesthesia for the procedure.
* Visual evoked potential (VEP) measures the function of the visual pathway from the eye to the brain. To record the VEP, five electrodes are placed on the scalp and the eye is stimulated with flashes of light. Infants and very young children must be anesthetized for the procedure.
* Electroencephalogram (EEG) measures brain electrical activity, using electrodes placed on the scalp. The test is useful in defining seizures. The child may need to be sedated to keep still during the test.
* Skin biopsy A small piece of skin is removed (usually from the upper arm or shoulder) under local anesthetic to grow cells in the laboratory. This procedure is done at the start of the study and is repeated after 1 year if therapy results are promising.

No.analyzed is no.of subj out of overall no.of participants analyzed who have not been censored/had decline of disease manifestation at given time point, Baseline to Week 145|Change From Baseline in ML Scale Score, The combined motor/gait and language (ML) score, as derived from the Hamburg CLN2 rating scale, immediately preceding the first infusion. The combined ML score is determined as the sum of the 0-3 point motor (M) and language (L) subscales where 0 represents no function, and 3 represents normal function, and can range from 0 (severely impaired) to 6 (normal). Thus, high scores describe better function and low scores describe poor function.

Some participants did not have follow-up at all time points., Baseline to Week 49, Week 97, Week 145, & Week 169|Changes From Baseline in MLV Scale Score, The combined motor-language-vision (MLV) score, as derived from the Hamburg CLN2 rating scale, is determined as the sum of the 0-3 point motor (M), language (L) \& vision (V) subscales where 0 represents no function, and 3 represents normal function, and can range from 0 (severely impaired) to 9 (normal). Thus, high scores describe better function and low scores describe poor function.

Some participants did not have follow-up at all time points., Baseline to Week 49, Week 97, Week 145, & Week 169|Changes From Baseline in the 0-12 Point MLVS Motor, Language, Vision, and Seizure Subscales (MLVS) Score., The combined motor-language-vision-seizure (MLVS) score, as derived from the Hamburg CLN2 rating scale, is determined as the sum of the 0-3 point motor (M) and language (L) vision (V) and seizure (S) subscales where 0 represents no function, and 3 represents normal function, and can range from 0 (severely impaired) to 12 (normal). Thus, high scores describe better function and low scores describe poor function.
