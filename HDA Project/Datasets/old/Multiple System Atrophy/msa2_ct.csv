NCT02008721,Progression Rate of MSA Under EGCG Supplementation as Anti-Aggregation-Approach,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02008721,PROMESA,COMPLETED,"MSA is a rapidly progressive disorder with an average survival time of about 7 years after the first clinical manifestation. No potent symptomatic treatment is currently available. A disease-modifying therapy does not exist either. The growing understanding in recent years of the underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease allows the development of new treatment options that have a modifying effect on the disease progression. Therefore, treatments are urgently required that effect the central underlying pathological mechanism, which appears to be the intracellular aggregation of toxic oligomers of α-synuclein.

EGCG, a polyphenol found in green tea, has shown to inhibit the formation of toxic α-synuclein oligomers in vitro and has shown to transform α-synuclein-oligomers in non-toxic oligomer species. There is also evidence for a neuroprotective effect in MPTP-mouse models of PD and is an antioxidant and iron chelator. There are currently 63 clinical studies (http://clinicaltrial.gov) in which EGCG was applied for various indications, such as Multiple Sclerosis, various forms of cancer and Huntington's disease. All of which have shown good tolerability and safety with the applied doses of EGCG of up to 1200 mg per day, demonstrating the safety of the drug under controlled clinical conditions (see 5.3.1 for hepatotoxicity in uncontrolled conditions).

The total score of the UMSARS (Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale) is a disease specific rating scale that comprises the activities of daily living subscale and the motor examination subscale.

The activities of daily living subscale assesses motor symptoms and autonomic symptoms (items 1-12 of the UMSARS activities of daily living subscale) with scores from 0-4 for every item, resulting in a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 48. A higher score means a worse outcome. It also includes the 14 items of the UMSARS motor examination subscale with possible scores from 0-4 for every item, resulting in a score range from 0-56.

The total score of the UMSARS (Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale) is a disease specific rating scale that comprises the activities of daily living subscale and the motor examination subscale.

The activities of daily living subscale assesses motor symptoms and autonomic symptoms (items 1-12 of the UMSARS activities of daily living subscale) with scores from 0-4 for every item, resulting in a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 48. A higher score means a worse outcome. It also includes the 14 items of the UMSARS motor examination subscale with possible scores from 0-4 for every item, resulting in a score range from 0-56.

More specifically, the investigators perform liver function tests to check the levels of certain enzymes and proteins in participants' blood. Levels that are higher or lower than normal can indicate liver problems. The liver function tests include:

Alanine transaminase (ALT), Aspartate transaminase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase (AP), and bilirubin., 6 months","Changes in C-peptide Levels in Participants Assessed by the ELISA Assay, The investigators determine the effect of dantrolene sodium on residual beta cell functions. The investigators monitor base-line C-peptide levels in participants' blood. The investigators also monitor C-peptide levels in participant's blood during the oral mixed meal tolerance test. The night before the oral mixed meal tolerance test, the participants will turn their insulin pump basal rate to 50% of the normal rate at midnight or take half of their evening dose of Lantus insulin and fasted from midnight until the test at 8 a.m. The mixed meal consists of 6 ml/kg (maximum 360 ml) of Boost Original (Société des Produits Nestlé S.A., Vevey, Switzerland). Blood for glucose and C-peptide measurement will be drawn at time 0 (fasting) and 30 minutes after the Boost. If a subject's fasting glucose exceeds 11.1 mmol/l, the test will not be performed, but fasting glucose and C-peptide will be obtained., 6 months|Changes in Visual Functioning in Participants Assessed by Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25., Changes in Visual Functioning in participants assessed by Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25.

The Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25) is divided into several subdomains, each assessing a specific aspect of visual functioning and its impact on an individual's life. There are a total of 11 subdomains in the VFQ-25. To calculate the total score on the VFQ-25, we follow these steps:

1. Calculate Subdomain Scores,
2. Weighted Sum
3. Calculate Total Score VFQ-25 provides scores that range from 0 to 100. The total score represents the overall impact of visual functioning on the individual's quality of life, with higher scores indicating better quality of life and less impact from vision problems., 6 months|Changes in Best-corrected Visual Acuity in Participants Measured by LogMar Score, Best-corrected visual acuity is assessed using the Snellen optotype and then converted into LogMar Scores (Minimum: -0.30, Maximum: 3.0). A higher LogMar score signifies poorer vision., 6 months|Changes in Neurological Functions in Participants Assessed by the Wolfram Unified Rating Scale (WURS), Neurological functions are assessed by the Wolfram Unified Rating Scale (WURS). The WURS is divided into the following subscales: Physical Assessment and Behavioral Assessment. Physical Assessment (34 items rated on a scale from 0 = no symptoms to 4 = highest severity, minimum: 0, Maximum: 136) and Behavioral Assessment (9 items rated on frequency and severity from 0 = normal behavior to 3 = highest severity, Minimum: 0, Maximum: 27). Subscale scores are summed to calculate the total scores (minimum: 0, Maximum: 163).

An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with study drug. Worsening of a pre-existing medical condition, (that is, diabetes, migraine headaches, gout) should have been considered an AE if there was either an increase in severity, frequency, or duration of the condition or an association with significantly worse outcomes.
