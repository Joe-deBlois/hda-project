NCT00977665,"Clinical Trial to Assess Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Rasagiline Mesylate 1 mg in Patients With Multiple System Atrophy of the Parkinsonian Subtype (MSA-P)",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00977665,,COMPLETED,To test the clinical effect of rasagiline on subjects with MSA of the parkinsonian subtype.,YES,Multiple System Atrophy,DRUG: rasagiline mesylate|DRUG: placebo,"Change From Baseline to Week 48/Termination Visit in the Total Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS Part I and II), This outcome represents the sum of 2 UMSARS sub-scales: Part I: Historical Review that includes 12 items and Part II: Motor Examination that includes 14 items. All items range from 0 to 4. Each subscale score is the sum of its items and the total UMSARS score is the sum of all 26 items. Hence the total UMSARS score can range from 0 to 104, with 0 meaning no impairment and 104 indicating severe impairment. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.

In the case that 6 items or more (out of 26) were missing at a certain visit, the UMSARS score for that visit was assigned a missing value., Day 0 (baseline), Week 48","Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) at Week 48/Termination Visit, Outcome measures the investigator's clinical impression of the participants' improvement at Week 48 as compared to Week 12. CGI scale range from 1-7, with 1=very much improved, 4= no change, and 7=very much worse.

In order to maintain the overall (hypotheses about primary and key secondary endpoints) type I error at the 0.05 level an hierarchy will be employed as follows: If the primary endpoint will be found to be significant at a significance level of 0.05 then the first key secondary endpoint will be tested, if this endpoint will be found to be significant in a significance level of 0.05 then the second key secondary endpoint will be tested and so on. The 'key' secondary endpoints are outcomes 2-6., Week 48|Change From Baseline to Week 24 in Total Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) Score, The UMSARS is composed of 2 sub-scales: Part I: Historical Review that includes 12 items and Part II: Motor Examination that includes 14 items. All items range from 0 to 4. Each subscale score is the sum of its items and the total UMSARS score is the sum of all 26 items. Hence the total UMSARS score can range from 0 to 104, with 0 meaning no impairment and 104 indicating severe impairment. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement.

In the case that 6 items or more (out of 26) were missing at a certain visit, the UMSARS score for that visit was assigned a missing value., Day 0 (baseline), Week 24|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Score of >=3 on the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) Question #7 Regarding Ambulation, UMSARS' Question #7 concerns the participant's ability to walk, rated on a scale of 0=normal to 4=cannot walk at all even with assistance. This endpoint counts participants rated a 3 or worse. Rating 3 = Severely impaired; assistance and/or walking aid needed occasionally., up to week 48|Mean Score of the Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale Select (COMPASS_Select Change) at Week 48/Termination Visit, COMPASS\_Select change is comprised of 5 of the 11 domains in the COMPASS scale: Orthostatic Intolerance, Bladder Disorder, Sweating, Vasomotor, and Sleep Disorder COMPASS\_Select change has a range of -150 to 150, with -150 indicating symptoms are much better and 150 indicating symptoms are much worse., 48 weeks|Change From Baseline to Week 48/Termination Visit in the Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) Health-related Quality of Life (QoL) Scale, The Multiple System Atrophy Quality of Life questionnaire (MSA-QoL) is a self-reported questionnaire focusing on MSA-specific symptoms and has a scale ranging from 0 - 160, with 0= 'no problem' and 160= ""extreme problem""., Day 0 (baseline), Week 48|Rate of Progression in Total Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) Score From Baseline to Weeks 12-48, The UMSARS is composed of 2 sub-scales: Part I: Historical Review that includes 12 items and Part II: Motor Examination that includes 14 items. All items range from 0 to 4. Each subscale score is the sum of its items and the total UMSARS score is the sum of all 26 items. Hence the total UMSARS score can range from 0 to 104, with 0 meaning no impairment and 104 indicating severe impairment.

The rate of progression of atrophy is represented by the slope of change from baseline scores for visits between Weeks 12 and 48., Day 0 (baseline), Weeks 12-48|Change From Baseline to Week 48 or Termination in UMSARS Subscores for Parts I, II and IV, UMSARS Part I is an historical review and scores symptoms of neurological and autonomic dysfunction with 12 items rated on a scale of 0 (normal) to 4 (extreme dysfunction). The full scale for Part 1 is therefore 0 (normal) to 48 (extreme dysfunction). Part II is a motor examination and has 14 items also rated on a scale of 0 to 4 for a full scale of 0 (normal) to 56 (extreme dysfunction). Part IV is a global disability scale with rates the extent of disease from 1 (normal) to 5 (severe disease)., Day 0 (baseline), Week 48 or termination visit|Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Total UMSARS Score for Symptomatic Effect, This outcome represents the sum of 2 UMSARS sub-scales: Part I: Historical Review that includes 12 items and Part II: Motor Examination that includes 14 items. All items range from 0 to 4. Each subscale score is the sum of its items and the total UMSARS score is the sum of all 26 items. Hence the total UMSARS score can range from 0 to 104, with 0 meaning no impairment and 104 indicating severe impairment. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement., Day 0 (baseline), Week 12|Estimates for Time to Change in Anti-Parkinsonian or Anti-Orthostatis Hypotension Medications, Change in anti-parkinsonian or anti-orthostatic hypotension medication is defined by at least one of the following events:

1. An addition of a new anti-parkinsonian or anti-orthostatic hypotension medication during study.
2. Dose modification of anti-parkinsonian or anti-orthostatic hypotension concomitant medications reflecting disease progression.

The event of interest, determined on a by patient basis, therefore, is the earliest event of the two events defined above. Otherwise, patient is right censored according to his/her study termination date.

Since less than 25% of participants had an event, median estimatation for time to change in medications is not possible., Day 0 (baseline) to Week 48 or termination visit|Change From Baseline to Week 48 or Termination in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) Scale, MoCA is a cognitive screening test which helps health professionals identify mild cognitive impairment. The total scale is 0 (significant cognitive impairment) to 30 (no impairment detected). Scores \>=26 are considered normal. Positive change from baseline scores indicate improvement in cognition., Day 0 (baseline), Week 48 or termination visit|Percentage of Participants Who Achieved a Score of >=3 on the Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale (UMSARS) Question #1 (Speech Impairment), Question #2 (Swallowing Impairment) and Question #8 (Falling), UMSARS' questions are rated on a scale of 0=normal to 4=extreme impairment.

This endpoint reports the percentage of participants rated a 3 or worse. Rating 3 = Severely impaired speech (Question #1), swallowing (Question #2) or falling more frequently than once per week (Question #8)., up to week 48|Change From Baseline to Week 48 or Termination in the Beck Depression Inventory Scale (BDI-II), The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used instruments for measuring the severity of depression. Participants are asked to pick the answer for each question that best describes the way they have been feeling in the past two weeks, including the day participants complete the questionnaire. Each question is rated on a scale of 0-3, with 0 meaning the participant does not feel the emotion described in the question, and 3 meaning the participant has extremely strong feelings. Total scale is 0 (no evidence of depression) to 63 (extreme depression). Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement in level of depression., Day 0 (baseline), Week 48 or termination visit|Total Number of Falls During the Study, Participants recorded each time they fell during the study in a diary., Day 1 up to week 48",,"Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc.",H.
