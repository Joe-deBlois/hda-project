NCT02008721,Progression Rate of MSA Under EGCG Supplementation as Anti-Aggregation-Approach,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02008721,PROMESA,COMPLETED,"MSA is a rapidly progressive disorder with an average survival time of about 7 years after the first clinical manifestation. No potent symptomatic treatment is currently available. A disease-modifying therapy does not exist either. The growing understanding in recent years of the underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease allows the development of new treatment options that have a modifying effect on the disease progression. Therefore, treatments are urgently required that effect the central underlying pathological mechanism, which appears to be the intracellular aggregation of toxic oligomers of α-synuclein.

EGCG, a polyphenol found in green tea, has shown to inhibit the formation of toxic α-synuclein oligomers in vitro and has shown to transform α-synuclein-oligomers in non-toxic oligomer species. There is also evidence for a neuroprotective effect in MPTP-mouse models of PD and is an antioxidant and iron chelator. There are currently 63 clinical studies (http://clinicaltrial.gov) in which EGCG was applied for various indications, such as Multiple Sclerosis, various forms of cancer and Huntington's disease. All of which have shown good tolerability and safety with the applied doses of EGCG of up to 1200 mg per day, demonstrating the safety of the drug under controlled clinical conditions (see 5.3.1 for hepatotoxicity in uncontrolled conditions).

These data provide a solid rationale for testing in a clinical trial if supplementation of EGCG can interfere with the core disease mechanism in MSA and consequently retard the clinical progression of the MSA-related disability.",YES,Multiple System Atrophy,DRUG: EGCG as putative neuroprotective agent|DRUG: Placebo,"Change of Score in Motor Examination (ME) of the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS-ME) From V1 to V7., To assess the efficacy of EGCG vs. Placebo to reduce the progression in the motor examination (ME) of the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS-ME) from V1 to V7.

The total score of the UMSARS (Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale) is a disease specific rating scale that comprises the activities of daily living subscale and the motor examination subscale.

The activities of daily living subscale assesses motor symptoms and autonomic symptoms (items 1-12 of the UMSARS activities of daily living subscale) with scores from 0-4 for every item, resulting in a minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 48. A higher score means a worse outcome. It also includes the 14 items of the UMSARS motor examination subscale with possible scores from 0-4 for every item, resulting in a score range from 0-56. The UMSARS total score hence shows a range from 0 to 104.

The cause of the MSA remains unclear. Available treatment is symptomatic only and does not alter the course of disease.

Although the cause of MSA remains unclear, there is evidence of presence of common neuroinflammatory mechanisms in the MSA brains including activation of microglia and production of toxic cytokines. This research protocol is based on hypothesis that the MSA progression can be altered by blocking the neuroinflammatory activity.

This protocol includes administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). IVIg contains antibodies derived from human plasma which can block the inflammatory responses in the brain that can lead to loss of brain cells.",YES,Multiple System Atrophy,DRUG: intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg),"Number of Adverse Events up to Six Months Post-treatment, The primary outcome measure was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the IVIG infusions in patients with multiple system atrophy. The primary endpoint was defined as the frequency of adverse events (AE). AEs including their severity and relationship to the IVIG were assessed throughout the study and at least 60 days after the last infusion. The AEs were considered to be related to the IVIG infusion (infusional AE) if they occurred during an infusion or within 72 hours afterwards. Non-infusional AEs were further classified as possible related to IVIG or likely not related to IVIG. Serious AEs assessed include medical occurrences that result in death, are life threatening, require hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. Any AE was defined as occurrence of any symptom regardless of intensity grade., Monthly, up to 8 months (including the screening visit and the final visit)","Preliminary Efficacy of IVIg for Treatment of MSA., The secondary outcome measure was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of IVIG for the treatment of MSA.
