The time limit to complete the task is 240 seconds, at which point the test is stopped and scored using the maximum allowable time if not yet completed. Greater time indicates greater impairment. Negative change from baseline indicates less impairment., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the One Touch Stockings of Cambridge (OTS-Mean Latency Until Correct Response), The OTS is a computerized test of executive function to assess problem-solving and planning ability. In this task, participants are shown a set of colored balls and must determine the minimum number of moves required to match a target arrangement by moving one ball at a time into one of two available locations. The goal is to perform the task using the smallest number of moves possible. The participant selects the correct number of moves from the options shown on the screen. The time to correct response is measured. Longer times indicate greater impairment. Negative change from baseline indicates an improvement in performance., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the Paced Tapping Test (PTAP), The PTAP is a test of motor timing in which participants synchronize their finger taps with auditory pacing tones during an initial paced phase. This is followed by a self-paced phase, where the tones are removed, and the participant continues tapping until a final auditory cue signals the end of the test. The primary outcome is paced tapping consistency, calculated as the inverse of the standard deviation of the intertap intervals per millisecond (1/msec), with no range specified. Higher values indicate greater timing accuracy., Baseline, Day 84|Change From Baseline in the Huntington's Disease Everyday Functioning (Hi-DEF) Home Subdomain Score, Hi-DEF Scale: self-reported measure to capture difficulties experienced in daily life due to HD across 4 areas of functioning: At home, At work, Driving, \& Relationships.

NCT00670709,Examination of Quantitative Electroencephalographic (QEEG) Biomarkers in Huntington's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00670709,HD,COMPLETED,"The pace of basic science research defining the mechanisms of selective neuronal degeneration in Huntington disease (HD) has far exceeded the pace of translation of this information into clinically effective treatments for the disease. One reason for this bottleneck between bench and bedside is the paucity of available surrogate markers for HD. Identification of surrogate markers is critical for the design of future clinical trials. Such markers could provide a reliable signal of early brain dysfunction in HD and could be used as a biomarker in trials of agents that could prevent onset or delay progression of disease.

Frontal-subcortical networks are known to be affected in HD and contribute to the cognitive dysfunction characteristic of the disease. Quantitative EEG (QEEG) can be used to assess the integrity of this circuitry; characteristic QEEG abnormalities long have been known to be present in the early stages of the illness (Bylsma et al., 1994). More recent research has suggested that a comprehensive topographic approach to QEEG analysis may reveal additional changes in brain activity (Bellotti et al., 2004) that may be indicative of subclinical disease (de Tommaso et al., 2003). This proposal aims to determine whether quantitative EEG techniques can be used to identify HD-specific abnormalities and thus serve as surrogate markers of disease.

The goals of this pilot project are three-fold. First, we will determine if there are QEEG differences between normal control subjects and those with mild or moderate HD.

Components of the full UHDRS assess motor function, cognition, behaviour, functional abilities, independence scale and total functional capacities. Motor function assessment includes TMS and Total Functional Capacity (TFC) score. The UHDRS TMS assesses all the motor features of HD and includes maximal chorea, maximal dystonia, ocular pursuit, saccade initiation and velocity, dysarthria, tongue protrusion, finger tapping, hand pronation and supination, luria, rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, tandem walking, and retropulsion pull test. Each of these was rated on a scale of 0 (normal motor function) to 4 (severely impaired motor function). TMS score is a sum of individual scores ranging from 0 (normal motor function) to 124 (severely impaired motor function). Lower TMS scores indicate better motor function., Baseline, Week 52","Percent Change From Baseline in Caudate Volume (Brain Atrophy) at Week 52, Brain atrophy was assessed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of caudate volume. Caudate volume atrophy is a sensitive biomarker in very early HD and correlates with disease progression. Brain atrophy in the caudate refers to the shrinkage in volume, so that a decrease in volume is a positive value, while an increase in volume is a negative value. Percent change in caudate volume at Week 52 was calculated as the change in caudate volume since the baseline visit, divided by the baseline caudate volume and multiplied by 100., Baseline, Week 52",,"Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc.",,ALL,ADULT,PHASE2,352,INDUSTRY,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: TRIPLE (PARTICIPANT, CARE_PROVIDER, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT",TV5600-CNS-20007|2014-000418-75,2014-10-28,2018-06-19,2018-06-19,2014-08-13,2019-06-19,2020-05-04,"Teva Investigational Site 12566, La Jolla, California, 92037, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12565, Los Angeles, California, 90095, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12567, San Francisco, California, 94143, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12575, Englewood, Colorado, 80113, United States|Teva Investigational Site 13490, Tampa, Florida, 33612, United States|Teva Investigational Site 13326, Iowa City, Iowa, 52242, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12568, Wichita, Kansas, 67226, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12574, Baltimore, Maryland, 21287-0005, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12571, Golden Valley, Minnesota, 55427, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12572, St Louis, Missouri, 63110, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12570, New York, New York, 10032, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12569, Rochester, New York, 14618, United States|Teva Investigational Site 13489, Memphis, Tennessee, 38163, United States|Teva Investigational Site 13325, Nashville, Tennessee, 37232, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12815, Houston, Texas, 77030, United States|Teva Investigational Site 12576, Kirkland, Washington, 98034, United States|Teva Investigational Site 11080, Vancouver, British Columbia, V6T 2B5, Canada|Teva Investigational Site 11118, Ottawa, Ontario, K1G 4G3, Canada|Teva Investigational Site 11079, Toronto, Ontario, M3B 2S7, Canada|Teva Investigational Site 11124, Edmonton, T6G 2G3, Canada|Teva Investigational Site 54108, Prague, 12800, Czechia|Teva Investigational Site 32480, Berlin, 10117, Germany|Teva Investigational Site 32482, Bochum, 44791, Germany|Teva Investigational Site 32618, Erlangen, 91054, Germany|Teva Investigational Site 32483, München, 81675, Germany|Teva Investigational Site 32481, Münster, 48149, Germany|Teva Investigational Site 32479, Ulm, 89081, Germany|Teva Investigational Site 30168, Bologna, 40139, Italy|Teva Investigational Site 30098, Milan, 20133, Italy|Teva Investigational Site 30100, Milan, 20133, Italy|Teva Investigational Site 30097, Napoli, 80131, Italy|Teva Investigational Site 30099, San Giovanni Rotondo, 71013, Italy|Teva Investigational Site 38066, Leiden, 2333 ZA, Netherlands|Teva Investigational Site 36026, Lisbon, 1649-035, Portugal|Teva Investigational Site 50379, Kazan', 420101, Russia|Teva Investigational Site 50380, Moscow, 125367, Russia|Teva Investigational Site 50381, Nyznij Novgorod, 603126, Russia|Teva Investigational Site 31185, Barakaldo, 48903, Spain|Teva Investigational Site 31097, Barcelona, 8036, Spain|Teva Investigational Site 31110, Barcelona, 8041, Spain|Teva Investigational Site 31186, Burgos, 09006, Spain|Teva Investigational Site 31131, Madrid, 28034, Spain|Teva Investigational Site 31187, Seville, 41009, Spain|Teva Investigational Site 34176, Aberdeen, AB25 2ZN, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34177, Birmingham, B15 2SG, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34194, Liverpool, L9 7LJ, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34179, London, NW1 2PG, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34209, London, SE1 9RT, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34204, London, SW17 0QT, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34203, London, W12 0NN, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34175, Manchester, M13 9WL, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34215, Newcastle upon Tyne, NE6 4QD, United Kingdom|Teva Investigational Site 34216, Sheffield, S5 7AU, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/16/NCT02215616/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/16/NCT02215616/SAP_001.pdf"

NCT01590888,Effect of PBT2 in Patients With Early to Mid Stage Huntington Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01590888,Reach2HD,COMPLETED,"Huntington disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease which affects over 30,000 people in both the United States and Australia. HD is characterized by brain cell death that usually begins between the ages of 30 to 50, and results in motor, cognitive and behavioral signs and symptoms. While there are medications to help relieve some of the disease symptoms, there is no known treatment to address the cognitive impairment associated with HD.

Normally occurring metals in the brain play a significant role in diseases such as Alzheimer disease and HD. PBT2 is a drug designed to interrupt interactions between these biological metals and target proteins in the brain, to prevent deterioration of brain cells. PBT2, has shown in animal models, and as well as in a small group of patients with Alzheimer's disease, it may improve cognition. There is some indication in animal models of HD, that the drug may improve motor function and control and reduce the amount of brain cell degeneration.

PBT2-203 will evaluate how safe and well tolerated PBT2 is at a dose of 100 mg or 250 mg a day administered as oral daily capsules compared to a placebo over a six month treatment period. The trial will also measure whether there is an effect on cognitive abilities as well as other HD symptoms including motor and overall functioning of individuals with HD.",YES,Huntington Disease,DRUG: PBT2|DRUG: PBT2|DRUG: Placebo,"Safety and Tolerability of PBT2 in Patients With HD, As measured by the total number of participants in each dose group who reported at least one adverse events during the study,, Baseline to 26 weeks","Change From Baseline in Cognitive Test Battery - Composite z Scores, Cognition composite z-scores were calculated for each participant.
