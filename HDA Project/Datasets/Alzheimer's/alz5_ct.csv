NCT03638323,Age-related Hearing Loss and Lexical Disorders,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03638323,LOOP,COMPLETED,"In France, Alzheimer's disease accounts for 70 to 80% of the causes of neurocognitive disorders, i.e. 600,000 to 800,000 patients. It is a neurodegenerative pathology that causes evolutionary cognitive dysfunction, mainly affecting memory functions. The inability to name familiar objects (lack of the word) is one of the most commonly noted symptoms at an early stage of the disease.

Presbyacusis, or age-related hearing loss, is the most common sensory deficit in the elderly which is manifested socially by a progressive discomfort of verbal communication. Presbyacusis remains underdiagnosed and undertreated: 2/3 of the patients are not using hearing aid.

In recent years, a link between neurocognitive disorders and hearing loss has been shown by investigating general cognition.

Three-quarters of hospitalized persons with ADRD display Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) associated with functional and cognitive decline, increased resource consumption, institutionalization, premature death, and caregiver burden. The overall objective is to test the preliminary efficacy of an innovative model of care, PES-4-BPSD, for reducing BPSD by empowering Patient Engagement Specialists (PES) to deliver dementia care for acutely-ill patients with ADRD. Traditionally, mental health assistants with training in crisis-prevention techniques provide care to psychiatric patients. On the intervention unit, these mental health assistants, as PES, purposefully engage patients with BPSD. In the pilot study, investigators found patients with cognitive impairment admitted to the PES unit were significantly less likely to require constant observation, chemical and physical restraints, suggesting improved management of BPSD. The central hypothesis is that PES-4-BPSD will improve the ability of PES to create an ""enabling"" milieu that addresses factors leading to BPSD and improves the experience of hospital caregivers. Guided by a social-ecological framework, PES-4-BPSD incorporates dementia education and training, environmental modifications-cohorting, increased staffing-PES, and staff support. The investigators' multidisciplinary research team is well-positioned to accomplish the following: Aim 1) Determine the preliminary efficacy of PES-4-BPSD for reducing BPSD during hospitalization, and Aim 2) Evaluate whether dementia care training improves the perceived ability of PES staff (intervention) and nurse assistant staff (control) to care for hospitalized persons with ADRD. For Aim 1, investigators will conduct a non-randomized preliminary efficacy trial of the PES-4-BPSD intervention enrolling N=158 patients (79 control, 79 intervention). The primary outcome will be presence of BPSD during hospitalization using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q). In Aim 2, investigators will use survey methodology in a repeated measures design to evaluate within and between-group differences in attitudes, experience, and satisfaction toward managing patients with ADRD. Measures will be completed at baseline (T1), immediately following training (T2), and at the end of the intervention period (T3). This proposal will be the first to study an innovative model of care utilizing PES as specialized hospital caregivers for reducing BPSD in the hospital setting.

Many older adults who live in senior communities, such as independent living and assisted living residences, find wayfinding very challenging. Often times, these communities are not designed in a way that helps people find their way very easily. When people cannot find their way, they can get lost, be dependent upon others for getting out and about, or even be afraid to leave their rooms. The purpose of this study is to find out if distinctive signs and decorative elements, along with a special type of education called Spaced-Retrieval education, help residents in these communities find their way more effectively. Twelve senior communities will be assigned by chance to one of three conditions, including: 1) control - no change (the community stays the same); 2) signs and decorative elements enhanced; and 3) signs, decorative elements, and special education added. After agreeing to be in the study, the participants will be asked to find their way to certain places in their community four times over a year. Some people will be asked to participate in educational sessions on wayfinding. In addition, some people will be asked to wear a location tracker, (like a fitness tracker), for four weeks during the year. How well people find their way, along with how much they travel about within the communities, will be compared between the three groups. It is hypothesized that those in the communities with special signs and decorative elements will find their way more effectively than those in the control communities. It is also hypothesized that participants in the communities with the special education intervention will find their way better than those without the education. Finally, it is hypothesized that participants in the communities with signs and cues and education will travel about further distances than those in the control communities.

NCT04428112,Rural Dementia Caregiver Project,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04428112,,COMPLETED,"Rural caregivers face challenges of geographic isolation and lower health care access and quality. Many rural dementia caregivers experience serious health consequences due to caregiving responsibilities that can limit their ability to maintain their caregiving role. Thus, there is a pressing need for effective, scalable, and accessible programs to support rural dementia caregivers.

Online programs offer a convenient and readily translatable option for program delivery because they can be accessed by caregivers in the home and at the convenience of the user. Building Better Caregivers is an online 6-week, interactive, small-group self-management, social support, and skills-building workshop developed for caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia.

The investigators will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation randomized controlled trial that will enroll and randomize 640 rural dementia caregivers into two groups: the intervention (workshop) group and the attention control group. Caregivers will be recruited throughout the United States. Primary outcomes will be caregiver stress and depressive symptoms. The investigators hypothesize that stress scores and depressive symptoms will be significantly improved at 12 months in the intervention group versus control group. The investigators will also identify key strengths (facilitators) and weaknesses (barriers) of workshop implementation. The investigators will use the RE-AIM implementation framework and a mixed methods approach to identify implementation characteristics pertinent to both caregivers and rural community organizations.

If the Building Better Caregivers workshop is proven to be effective, this research has the potential to open new research horizons, particularly on how to reach and effectively support isolated dementia caregivers in rural areas with an intervention that is scalable, even in low-resourced settings. If the workshop can achieve its goals with rural dementia caregivers, some of those most isolated, it would also be expected to be scalable in other low-resourced settings (e.g., in urban or suburban environments).",YES,"Depression|Stress, Psychological|Self Efficacy|Loneliness|Social Isolation|Health Care Utilization|Dementia|Dementia Alzheimers|Dementia of Alzheimer Type|Dementia, Vascular|Dementia Frontal|Dementia, Lewy Body|Dementia, Mixed|Dementia in Parkinsons Disease|Dementia, HIV|Dementia Frontotemporal|Dementia, Multi-Infarct",BEHAVIORAL: Building Better Caregivers Workshop|BEHAVIORAL: Attention Control,"Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) Scale Score, Personal Health Questionnaire Depression (PHQ-8) scale.

NCT04235374,Implementation of Function Focused Care in Acute Care,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04235374,,COMPLETED,"Older adults with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD) comprise approximately 25% of hospitalized older adults. These individuals are at increased risk for functional decline, delirium, falls, behavioral symptoms associated with dementia (BPSD) and longer lengths of stay. Physical activity during hospitalization (e.g., mobility,bathing, dressing) has a positive impact on older adults including prevention of functional decline, less pain, less delirium, less BPSD, fewer falls, shorter length of stay and decreased unplanned hospital readmissions. Despite known benefits, physical activity is not routinely encouraged and older hospitalized patients spend over 80% of their acute care stay in bed. Challenges to increasing physical activity among older patients with ADRD include environment and policy issues (e.g., lack of access to areas to walk); lack of knowledge among nurses on how to evaluate, prevent and manage delirium and BPSD; inappropriate use of tethers; beliefs among patients, families, and nurses that bed rests helps recovery and prevents falls; and lack of motivation/willingness of patients to get out of bed. To increase physical activity and prevent functional decline while hospitalized we developed Function Focused Care for Acute Care (FFC-AC-EIT) for patients with ADRD. Implementation of FFC-AC-EIT changes how care is provided by having nurses teach, cue, and help patients with ADRD engage in physical activity during all care interactions. FFC-AC-EIT was developed using a social ecological model, social cognitive theory and the Evidence Integration Triangle. It involves a four-step approach that includes: (1) Environment and Policy Assessments; (2) Education; (3) Establishing Patient Goals; and (4) Mentoring and Motivating of Staff, Patients and Families. The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of FFC-AC-EIT within 12 hospitals in Maryland and Pennsylvania randomized to FFC-AC-EIT or Function Focused Care Education Only (EO) with 50 patients recruited per hospital (total sample 600 patients). Aim 1 will focus on efficacy at the patient level based primarily on physical activity, function, and participation in function focused care, and secondarily on delirium, BPSD, pain, falls, use of tethers, and length of stay; and all of these outcomes (except length of stay and tethers) along with emergency room visits, re-hospitalizations and new long term care admissions at 1, 6 and 12 months post discharge; and at the unit level the aim is to evaluate the impact of FFC-AC-EIT on policies and environments that facilitate function and physical activity at 6, 12 and 18 months post implementation. Hospitals randomized to FFC-AC-EIT will be compared with those randomized to Function Focused Care Education Only (EO). Aim 2 will evaluate the feasibility, based on treatment fidelity (delivery, receipt, enactment)136, and relative cost and cost savings of FFC-AC-EIT versus EO.

NCT04080544,Cognitive Decline and Alzheimer's Disease in the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04080544,,COMPLETED,The investigators will conduct tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans on 125 adults using the radiopharmaceutical Flortaucipir F18 (\[18F\]AV-1451). This will allow the investigators to determine tau deposition across adults of different ages and assess the relationship of current tau burden to cognitive function and amyloid deposition collected over the previous 10-year interval.,YES,Alzheimer Disease|Cognitive Decline,DRUG: [18F]AV-1451|PROCEDURE: Positron Emission Tomography,"Standardized Uptake Value Ratios (SUVrs) Calculated From [18F]AV-1451 PET Scans, Tau accumulation in the temporal lobe will be measured as the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) computed from each participant's \[18F\]AV-1451 PET scans averaged across six bilateral regions of interest (ROls) by normalizing regional counts to the whole cerebellum. The 6 ROls are: inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Each participant's PET scan and the six bilateral ROIs will be coregistered to their T1-weighted MRI (MP-RAGE). Finally, the mean observed tracer count from each region will be extracted and normalized using whole cerebellum as the reference. Observed tau SUVR scores in humans range from 0.5 to 2.5, with higher scores being indicative of greater tau accumulation. Unless otherwise specified, all subsequent analyses will use this temporal tau SUVR and will involve examination of cross-sectional relationships between tau SUVR and key outcome measures at Wave 3 of the DLBS., An average of 3-months post-PET study visit","Relationship of Tau Burden to Episodic Memory Function, Episodic memory is a construct that measures how well individuals can store, maintain, and retrieve detailed information in long-term memory. Episodic memory will be a composite score using the Hopkins Verbal Learning test with 3 subcomponents (immediate recall: range 0-12, delayed recall: range 0-12, and recognition: range 0-24) and the immediate recall of the CANTAB Verbal Recognition Memory task (range 0-12). Scores from the tasks will be converted to Z-scores and averaged to form an episodic memory composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score. A higher composite Z-score indicates better episodic memory, a Z-score of 0 represents the population mean, and all Z-scores have a standard deviation of 1. Values in this table represent this Episodic Memory Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Amyloid Accumulation to Tau Burden, Amyloid accumulation throughout the Dallas Lifespan Brain Study (6-9.8 years) will be measured with Florbetapir F18 and calculated as an Amyloid Standard Uptake Value ratio (SUVR) by normalizing regional counts to the whole cerebellum. Amyloid SUVR scores will be averaged across eight cortical regions spanning most of the cortex: dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, lateral parietal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, lateral temporal cortex, and lateral occipital lobe. Amyloid SUVR scores observed in this study have ranged from 0.88 to 1.74, with higher scores being indicative of greater amyloid accumulation. Finally, annualized change scores for these amyloid SUVRs across the full study duration (6-9.8 years) will be calculated to determine the extent that the rate of amyloid accumulation relates to tau burden at the end of the study., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Speed of Processing, Speed of processing is a construct that measures how rapidly individuals can process information. To assess speed of processing, a composite score will be created using the Digit Comparison task and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Digit Symbol task. Observed DLBS raw scores range from 27 to 116 for Digit Comparison task and 20 to 90 for Digit Symbol task. Participants' raw scores are converted to Z-scores and averaged to form a speed of processing composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score. A higher composite Z-score indicates better speed of processing, a Z-score of 0 represents the population mean, and all Z-scores have a standard deviation of 1. Values in this table represent this Speed of Processing Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Reasoning, The construct of reasoning measures an individual's ability to recognize novel patterns and the conceptual relationship among objects and effectively apply these patterns to solve similar problems. To assess reasoning, a composite score will be created using the Raven's Progressive Matrices task and Educational Testing Service (ETS) Letters Sets task. Observed DLBS raw scores range from 9 to 30 for Raven's Progressive Matrices task and from 0.5 to 30 for ETS Letters Sets task. Raven's Progress Matrices and ETS Letter Sets will be converted to Z-scores and averaged to form a reasoning composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score. A higher composite Z-score indicates higher reasoning ability, a Z-score of 0 represents the population mean, and all Z-scores have a standard deviation of 1. Values in this table represent this Reasoning Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Working Memory, Working memory is a construct that measures the ability of individuals to simultaneously manipulate and store information. To assess working memory, a composite score will be created using the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task (reverse scored) and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-III) Letter Number Sequencing task. Observed DLBS raw scores range from 0 to 86 total errors for the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory task and 2 to 20 for the WAIS-III Letter Number Sequencing task. Participants' raw scores are converted to Z-scores and averaged to form a working memory composite, and then this final value with be converted to a Z-score. A higher working memory composite Z-score indicates better working memory, a Z-score of 0 represents the population mean, and all Z-scores have a standard deviation of 1. Values in this table represent this Working Memory Z-score., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Participants' Age, Linear regressions between the AV-1451 SUVR in each of the temporal regions of interest with participant age will be calculated, and in additional analyses, non-linear effects of age will be examined via quadratic and growth modeling. Observed AV-1451 SUVR scores in humans have ranged from 0.5 to 2.5, with higher scores being indicative of greater tau accumulation. The investigators predict that tau accumulation will accelerate in old age, thus supporting a non-linear rate of deposition., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Cortical Thickness, Regional cortical thickness will be estimated from previously acquired T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scans using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3), with surface parcellation manually edited when necessary by our team of experts. The regions selected for analyses of cortical thickness were the ROIs used to estimate temporal tau SUVR: inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus. Observed cortical thickness in these regions range from 1.38 to 3.83 mm with higher scores indicating greater thickness., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Hippocampal Volume, Hippocampal volume will be estimated from previously acquired T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scans using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3), with surface parcellation manually edited when necessary by our team of experts. This region was selected for analysis as it was one of the ROIs used to estimate temporal tau SUVR. Observed DLBS hippocampal volume ranged from 1843 to 5342 mm\^3 with higher scores indicating greater volume., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to White Matter Integrity, White matter integrity will be assessed using the estimated volume of white matter hypointensities from previously acquired T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRl) scans using FreeSurfer (ver. 5.3). Observed DLBS white matter hypointensities range from 796 to 35,037 mm\^3 with higher scores indicating greater volume of hypointensities and reflecting worse white matter integrity., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), For functional measures, blood oxygenation level dependent signal from contrasts of interest using selected ROls will be created. For the semantic judgment task (easy judgments - fixation), the investigators will focus on ROIs associated with processing meaning, including inferior frontal gyrus, precuneus, and middle temporal gyrus. Observed BOLD activation values (betas) ranged from -1.00 to 1.30 with higher values indicating greater activation., 1-year post study completion|Relationship of Tau Burden to Resting-State Brain System Segregation, Resting-state brain system segregation was computed on data collected from a separate resting-state scan using graph theory. System segregation is calculated as (Zw - Zb) / Zw, where Zw is the mean Fisher z-transformed r between nodes with the same system and Zb is the mean Fisher z-transformed r between nodes of one system to all nodes in other systems. Higher values indicate reduced node-node connectivity between systems relative to within-system connectivity. A score of 0 would reflect equal resting-state connectivity between nodes within the same functional system and between nodes of separate systems. Like all Z-scores, these scores typically range from -3 to 3. Higher scores are observed in younger adults than in older adults and may suggest a more youth-like brain, though higher scores are not objectively better. Systems were defined based on Power et al., (2011, Neuron) and more details on this measure are described in Chan et al.

Both situations lead to reduced quality of life and cardiovascular disease-a complication of uncontrolled hypertension. Maintaining the health of these caregivers is critical to support the well-being of the care recipients. Although some multi-component interventions have addressed ADRD caregiver's stress and quality of life, gaps remain in targeting interventions to address the complexity of chronic caregiving stress and hypertension self-care in African American women.

This pilot study builds on the investigator's earlier work which showed that stress, blood pressure knowledge, and complex diet information deficits all interfered with older African American women's hypertension self-care. Lifestyle changes (stress management, reducing sodium, eating fruits/vegetables, and physical activity) are effective in managing hypertension. The investigator's Stage I pilot study is based on the scientific rationale that these lifestyle changes can be promoted by addressing stress reactivity/stress resilience, the psychological and physiological response of the body to stress, as the underlying mechanism to facilitate behavioral change. In this way the study can improve health outcomes (caregiver stress, quality of life, cardiovascular disease risk).",YES,"Hypertension|Stress, Psychological",BEHAVIORAL: Caregiver Training,"Change in Blood Pressure (Systolic), Change is being assessed in systolic blood pressure measured with an automatic blood pressure cuff.
