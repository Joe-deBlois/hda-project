NCT02002819,Levetiracetam for Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Network Hyperexcitability,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02002819,LEV-AD,COMPLETED,"Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) can have seizures in addition to losing their memory and other mental functions (referred to as cognitive functions). The seizures, and other examples of overactive electrical activity in the brain that is not noticeable, contribute to the loss of cognitive function. Studies in animal models of AD suggest that a drug that prevents seizures called levetiracetam may reduce neuronal over-excitation and improve cognition. Based on this evidence, the investigators propose to determine if levetiracetam can be used to treat patients with AD. The investigators developed novel instruments for this population that will also be used in future large-scale clinical trials.

The current study will last for 12 weeks and will involve people with AD. Participants will be initially examined with an overnight brain wave study to assess for silent epileptic (seizure-like) activity. Presence of epileptic activity on the screening exam is not required to enter the trial. Participants will then be assigned to groups in a randomized manner. One group will receive levetiracetam for 4 weeks, then no drug for 4 weeks, and then placebo for 4 weeks. For another group, the order of treatments will be reversed. The cognitive abilities of participants will be retested every 4 weeks and compared to those at the beginning. The cognitive tests include a virtual-reality navigation test of memory and computerized tests of mental flexibility and problem solving. The participants will be monitored with a magnetoencephalogram (MEG) with simultaneous EEG (M/EEG) at each visit. M/EEG is a highly effective non-invasive method for identifying brain regions of epileptic activity. The investigators will need to recruit 36 randomized participants to test the study hypotheses. This study will take place at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) and the University of Minnesota.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: levetiracetam,"Changes in Executive Function as Measured by the NIH EXAMINER Computer Battery, Changes in executive function were measured using the NIH EXAMINER, a 1-hour computer-based battery of various executive function tasks.

It is used to assess whether zagotenemab slows down the cognitive and functional decline associated with early symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease, compared to placebo. The iADRS score ranges from 0 to 144 with lower scores indicating worse performance and higher score better performance. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline. Data presented are posterior mean with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 104","Change From Baseline on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) Score, The ADAS is a rater-administered instrument that was designed to assess the severity of the dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive behaviors characteristic of persons with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The cognitive subscale of the ADAS consists of 13 items assessing areas of cognitive function most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation, and maze completion measures. The ADAS-Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85, with higher scores indicating greater disease severity.

The ADCS-ADL measures basic, instrumental activities of daily living by participants (instrumental activity items 6a, 7-23). The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59, with lower scores indicating greater disease severity. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline. Data presented are posterior mean with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning: memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline. Data presented are posterior mean with 95% credible interval., Baseline, Week 104|Change From Baseline on the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) Score, The MMSE is a brief instrument used to assess cognitive function. The instrument is divided into 2 sections. The first section measures orientation, memory, and attention. The maximum score for the first section is 21. The second section tests the ability of the person to name objects, follow verbal and written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures. The maximum score for the second section is 9. The range for the total MMSE score is 0 to 30, with lower scores indicating greater level of impairment. Change from baseline was calculated using Bayesian disease progression model (DPM) with fixed, categorical effects of treatment, pooled site, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) use at baseline (yes/no), and the continuous effects of baseline score and age at baseline.

NCT04102514,A Dyadic Approach for a Remote Physical Activity Intervention in Adults With AD and Their Caregivers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04102514,,COMPLETED,"The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of 2 intervention delivery strategies for increasing moderate physical activity (MPA), real-time group video conferencing (RGV) vs. enhanced usual care (EUC), in community dwelling adults with Alzheimer's diseases (AD) and their caregiver (dyads) over 18 mos. (6 mos. active, 6 mos. maintenance, 6 mos. no contact). The primary outcome is to compare total MPA (min/wk.), assessed using ActiGraph, in adults with AD from baseline to 6 mos. Secondary aims for the Adults with AD are to compare MPA (min/wk), sedentary time (min/wk.), percentage meeting 150 min/wk. goal, functional fitness, activities of daily living (basic/instrumental), quality of life, residential transitions, and cognitive function across 18 months between RGV and EUC. Secondary aims for the caregivers are to compare total MPA (min/wk.), sedentary time (min/wk.), functional fitness, quality of life, caregiver burden across 18 months between RGV and EUC. Additionally, as an exploratory aim, this study will evaluate the influence of process variables/participant characteristics on MPA in adults with AD and their caregiver across 6, 12 \& 18 mos.: age, sex, BMI, attendance (exercise/support sessions), use of recorded videos, PA self-monitoring, peer interactions during group sessions, caregiver support, type and quality of dyadic relationship, and number of caregivers.",YES,Alzheimer Disease,BEHAVIORAL: Real-time Group Video|BEHAVIORAL: Enhanced Usual Care,"Moderate Physical Activity, Moderate physical activity will be assessed using an ActiGraph model wGT3x-BT triaxial at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months.

NCT01965756,Effect of Insulin Sensitizer Metformin on AD Biomarkers,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01965756,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions. It is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, affecting approximately 18 million people worldwide, including almost 500,000 in the Philadelphia tri-state area. After age 65, the incidence of AD rises exponentially, doubling every five years. By age 85, almost half of us will have AD. In 2030, as many as 7.7 million Americans could have AD, and by 2050 this number could rise to 11-16 million people. The annual cost of AD in the United States is about $200 billion. AD-related medical complications are among the most common causes of death in the elderly population. Despite these alarming statistics, a ""cure"" for AD may not be essential since delaying the onset of AD by just 5 years could have a profound impact on this disorder by reducing the incidence and cost of AD by 50% between now and 2050.

AD is difficult to recognize in its earliest stages, in which the principal complaint is typically an increase in episodes of forgetfulness. This stage is now commonly referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers have demonstrated good accuracy in predicting which MCI patients later ""convert"" to AD and which tend to remain stable or revert to more normal cognition. The diagnosis of AD itself is made when increased loss of memory and other cognitive abilities (eg, language, praxis, and executive function) affect daily functioning. As the symptoms of dementia inevitably worsen, patients may become incapable of even basic activities such as feeding and dressing themselves. The disease course often spans more than a decade, creating a vast social and financial burden on society and extracting an immeasurable emotional toll on family members.

The MMSE is a brief, global cognitive measure that includes orientation, memory, attention, concentration, naming, writing, repetition, comprehension, and construction. The total score ranges from 0 (worst) to 30 (best performance). Results of the MMSE for this trial were reported as a raw change score, calculated as the change between the total scores at two evaluation time points (Baseline, Pre-Confinement Visit) and where negative values are worse and positive values are better., MMSE was administered at Baseline and at the Pre-Confinement Visit 1-3 days prior to the Confinement Visit. This confinement visit occurred following 21-23 days of treatment with either Posiphen or placebo, while also allowing a +/- 2-day visit window.|Assessment of Neuropsychiatric Effects, The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) was used to measure the frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms. On this scale frequency ratings range from 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very frequently, once or more per day or continuously). Severity ratings range from 0 (no severity) to 3 (severe). The score for each of 12 symptoms measured in the scale is the product of severity and frequency within that symptom. The total score for the NPI is the sum of all 12 symptom item scores, for a highest possible total score of 144 in individuals with maximal symptoms, and a lowest possible total score of zero (0) in fully asymptomatic individuals. Lower scores are better and higher scores indicate more neuropsychiatric symptoms. Results are calculated as the change between the total scores at two evaluation time points (Baseline, Pre-Confinement Visit) with negative scores being better and positive scores being worse., NPI was administered at Baseline and at the Pre-Confinement Visit 1-3 days prior to the Confinement Visit. This confinement visit occurred following 21-23 days of treatment with either Posiphen or placebo, while also allowing a +/- 2-day visit window.|Assessment of Cognitive Effects, The short-term effects of Posiphen on cognition were measured using the The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive 12 (ADAS-Cog12). The ADAS-Cog is a structured scale that evaluates memory (word recall, word recognition), reasoning, language (naming, comprehension), orientation, ideational praxis and constructional praxis. The test is scored in terms of errors, with higher scores reflecting poorer performance and greater impairment. Total ADAS-Cog12 scores can range from 0 to 80, with lower scores being better and higher scores being worse.

The measure is a 9-item panel rating how caregivers experience feelings of positive affect and well-being. Responses are Likert scales, scored 1-5, Never (1), Rarely (2), Sometimes (3), Often (4), Always (5). Responses are summed for a final score and converted to a t-score per Neuro-QoL manual scoring conventions. Population mean T-Score is 50 and SD is 10. Higher scores indicate higher levels of Positive Affect and Well-Being. Positive change represents an increase in positive affect/well-being, and negative change represents a decrease., Baseline (pre-intervention) and 1 Month Post-intervention","Change in PROMIS Anxiety Score, The PROMIS Adult Emotional Distress-Anxiety scale measures self-reported fear (fearfulness, panic), anxious misery (worry, dread), and hyper-arousal (tension, nervousness, restlessness) in respondents during the past 7 days. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always). We deployed the four item short form, with scores ranging from 4-20, with higher scores indicating greater severity of anxiety. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. We calculate change in T-Score from baseline to one month per participant and take the mean of those observations to produce mean change in T-score by condition., 1 months post-baseline|Change in Zarit Caregiver Burden Score, The Zarit Burden Interview, a popular caregiver self-report measure used by many aging agencies, originated as a 29-item questionnaire (Zarit, Reever \& Bach-Peterson, 1980). The revised version contains 22 items. Each item on the interview is a statement which the caregiver is asked to endorse using a 5-point scale. Response options range from 0 (Never) to 4 (Nearly Always). The total score range is 0 to 88. Increasing scores indicate increasing burden.

Scores were measured at baseline and at 1 month post-intervention and a change score was computed for each participant. These change scores are averaged to produce the by-condition mean change in burden score. Positive results indicate an increase in burden, and negative results indicate a decrease in burden., 1 month post-baseline|Change in PROMIS Fatigue Score, The PROMIS Fatigue instruments evaluate a range of self-reported symptoms, from mild subjective feelings of tiredness to an overwhelming, debilitating, and sustained sense of exhaustion that likely decreases one's ability to execute daily activities and function normally in family or social roles. We deployed PROMIS Fatigue Form 7a, a seven item likert scale panel ranging from 1=never to 5=always. Scores range from 7-35. Higher scores indicate more fatigue. The T-score rescales the raw score into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore, a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean. We calculate change in T-Score from baseline to one month per participant and take the mean of those observations to produce mean change in T-score by condition., 1 month post-baseline|Change in PROMIS Short Form General Self Efficacy T Score, the PROMIS General Self-Efficacy - Short Form is a four item panel which measures confidence in one's ability to successfully perform specific tasks or behaviors related to one's health in a variety of situations. The four items are 1-5 Likert scales, 1=never, 5=always. Minimum score is a 4 and maximum is a 20. Raw Scores are converted to T scores with mean 50 and SD 10 per the PROMIS scoring manual. Higher score=greater self efficacy., 1 months post-baseline|PROMIS Short Form Emotional Support T Score at Baseline, PROMIS Emotional Support - Short Form.

The PROMIS Emotional Support item bank assesses perceived feelings of being cared for and valued as a person; having confident relationships. The short form 6a deployed here is a 6 item likert scale panel, which assesses responses as 1=never and 5=always in response to item statements. Minimum score is a 6 and maximum is a 30. Higher scores indicate greater feelings of emotional support. The raw score is rescaled per the PROMIS scoring manual into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean., Baseline Measure|Change in PROMIS Satisfaction With Social Roles/Activities Score, The PROMIS adult Satisfaction with Social Roles and Activities item bank assesses satisfaction with performing one's usual social roles and activities (e.g., ""I am satisfied with my ability to participate in family activities""). Short form 8a is deployed here. This is an 8 item likert scale panel, with responses rated 1=never and 5=always. Scores range from 8 to 40. Higher scores indicate greater satisfaction with social roles and activities. The raw score is rescaled per the PROMIS scoring manual into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation (SD) of 10. Therefore a person with a T-score of 40 is one SD below the mean., 1 months post-baseline|Change in Neuro-QoL Caregiver Specific Anxiety Score, TBI-CareQOL is a set of self-report measures within the Neuro-QoL™ measurement system that assesses the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of caregivers of adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Among these is the Caregiver specific anxiety measure. This is a six item likert panel with responses rated 1=never and 5=always, for a combined score range of 6-30. Higher scores indicate greater levels of anxiety. Raw scores were rescaled per the Neuro-QoL scoring manual into T-Scores with a mean of 50 and an SD of 10. Difference between T-score at baseline and 1-month was computed for each participant to produce a change score, and these change scores are averaged to produce per condition means., 1 month post-baseline","Participant Retention Rate at 3 Months Post-baseline, Percentage- numerator=# of participants who completed 3 month post-baseline assessment, denominator=# of participants randomized to a condition., 3 months post-baseline|System Usability Scale Score, Measuring the feasibility of the intervention by measuring the usability of the intervention as measured by the System Usability Scale (SUS), a 10-item measure of usability. SUS is a 10-item likert panel, with scores ranging from 1-5. Scores are tabulated by converting raw scores by subtracting 1 from each raw score and then summing per the scoring manual: summed score=2.5\*(20+(sum of odd numbered questions)-(sum of even number questions)). The minimum and maximum values are thus 50 and 100. Higher scores indicate greater usability., 2 weeks post-intervention|USE Acceptability Score, The USE Acceptability score measures the acceptability of the intervention, employing an 8-item panel of 1-7 Likert scale questions, with a 0 option for ""not applicable"". Raw score is converted to 0-100 score as follows: 2.040163\*(summed raw scores - 8). Higher scores indicate greater acceptability., 2 weeks post-intervention|Exercise Completion Rate, Measuring the feasibility of the intervention by assessing completion of negotiation training exercises., 2 weeks post-baseline|Change in DUTCH Conflict Handling Scores, The Dutch Test for Conflict Handling measures aspects of conflict resolution pertaining to the negotiator. The DUTCH measures conflict handling in five domains: avoiding, forcing, yielding, problem solving, and compromising. Each domain is measured independently using panels of four 1-5 likert scale questions each. Domain scores thus range from 5-20, converted to 0-100 with the following formula: 6.25\*(domain score-1). Intra-participant change is measured for each subdomain between baseline and 1 month and generalized to produce mean change per domain. Higher scores per domain indicate more intense conflict handling behavior in the given domain- lower scores indicate less intensity., 1 month post-baseline|Change in Negotiation Knowledge Scores, We deployed a panel of 15 questions measuring participant knowledge of negotiation techniques. The panel measures knowledge in three subdomains (identification of interests, rights, and power statements) and can also be measured in aggregate to assess knowledge across the three subdomains. Participants receive 1 point for each correct answer. All Scores, including subdomain scores, are converted to a 0/100 measure. Intraparticipant change is assessed between baseline and 1 month post-intervention. Dependent Sample T-Tests were performed on the change scores from baseline-1 month., 1 months post-baseline|Utilization Rates, We deployed a survey panel of 5 yes/no questions to participants asking them about utilization of negotiation techniques in the month following the intervention.

Each item is rated on a 5-point verbal frequency scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). Scores are evaluated out of 50. The ten item scales thus have score ranges from 10-50. Higher scores in a single domain indicate greater perception of that type of affect. So, higher positive affect scores=greater positive affect, and higher negative affect scores=higher negative affect. Positive change on either scale indicates an increase in that domain, and negative change on either scale indicates a decrease in that domain., 1 month post-baseline",Northwestern University,National Institute on Aging (NIA),ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",NA,132,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: FACTORIAL|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: OTHER,R01AG068421-01|1R01AG068421-01,2023-09-01,2024-04-20,2024-06-17,2021-04-08,2025-08-01,2025-08-01,"Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/37/NCT04837937/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/37/NCT04837937/SAP_001.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/37/NCT04837937/ICF_002.pdf"
NCT00933608,Effects of Memantine on Magnetic Resonance (MR) Spectroscopy in Subjects at Risk for Alzheimer's Disease,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00933608,,COMPLETED,"Recent data show that marked cell damage precedes the clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, targeting populations at risk with pharmacological interventions is a possible strategy to lessen the burden of the disease. Cognitively normal individuals with subjective memory complaints (SMC) manifest biological characteristics consistent with early AD and are at risk for future cognitive decline. Family history of AD also constitutes a risk. In a previous study the investigators showed that memantine slows down the accumulation of phosphorylated tau in normal SMC subjects. Using a multivoxel high field MR spectroscopy (MRS) technique, the investigators also demonstrated that memantine decreased hippocampal glutamate. Both these findings may be consistent with the drug's anti-excitotoxic activity. In this new project the investigators propose to treat a sample of 12 presymptomatic individuals at risk (SMC and family history of AD) with memantine. This will be a double blind, placebo controlled study with a control group (12 non-treated subjects). The investigators will determine whether the effects of memantine as assessed by cognitive performance and MRS are present after 4 months of treatment and persist 2 months after discontinuation. MRS will be used to evaluate the effect of memantine on levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate and neuronal viability marker N-acetylaspartate (NAA) in the hippocampus. The investigators will test the following hypotheses:

1. In subjects with SMC, memantine has modifying effects on brain biochemistry as reflected in MRS reductions in glutamate (reduced excitotoxicity) and increases in NAA (neuronal integrity).
2. The effects of the drug persist (as a marker of sustained neuroprotection) and can be measured 2 months after discontinuation of the treatment.",YES,Alzheimer's Disease,DRUG: memantine|DRUG: Placebo,"N-acetylaspartate, The change in N-acetylaspartate (NAA) measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is the primary outcome measure. NAA is a metabolite found predominately in neuronal cells, and its amount indicates tissue well being (the higher the better). In MRS studies NAA (and other metabolites like choline or myoinositol) are presented as a ratio to creatine (Cr) also measured by MRS. The concentration of creatine does not change is used as an internal standard. The ratio NAA/Cr is unitless. In summary, the measurable outcome will be the NAA/Cr ratio change from pre-to post treatment., baseline (pre-treatment) and 4 months (post-treatment)",,,NYU Langone Health,Forest Laboratories,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,17,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,"Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: DOUBLE (PARTICIPANT, INVESTIGATOR)|Primary Purpose: BASIC_SCIENCE",NAM-MD-68,2009-07,2011-09,2011-09,2009-07-07,2014-10-21,2014-10-21,"NYU School of Medicine, Dept. of Psychiatry, Center for Brain Health, New York, New York, 10016, United States",

Inappropriate prescribing can increase the overall symptom burden, and negatively affect health-related quality of life and function. The inappropriate prescription of certain drug categories such as sedative/hypnotics, antipsychotics, and strong anticholinergic agents poses particular risks for older adults, and may be more common among those with Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease- related dementias (AD/ADRD) due to a higher prevalence of multimorbidity and more frequent prescription of five or more medications. The D-PRESCRIBE-AD (Developing a PRogram to Educate and Sensitize Caregivers to Reduce the Inappropriate Prescription Burden in Elderly with Alzheimer's Disease) study will test a health plan-based intervention using the NIH Collaboratory's Distributed Research Network, which employs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Sentinel System infrastructure. The overarching goal of this randomized controlled trial is to assess the effect of a patient/caregiver- centered, multifaceted educational intervention on potentially inappropriate prescribing in patients with AD/ADRD. The research hypothesis is that education on inappropriate prescribing among patients/caregivers and their providers can reduce medication-related morbidity in patients with AD/ADRD and improve medication safety for this vulnerable population. The study population will include community-dwelling patients with AD/ADRD, identified based on diagnoses codes of AD/ADRD or use of a medication for Alzheimer's Disease, who have evidence of potentially inappropriate prescribing the three drug classes above.

The emotional and financial burden of AD to patients, family members, and society is enormous, and is predicted to grow exponentially as the median population age increases. Current FDA-approved therapies are modestly effective at best. This study will examine a novel therapeutic approach using intranasal insulin (INI) that has shown promise in short-term clinical trials. If successful, information gained from the study has the potential to move INI forward rapidly as a therapy for AD. The study will also provide evidence for the mechanisms through which INI may produce benefits by examining key cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and hippocampal/entorhinal atrophy. These results will have considerable clinical and scientific significance, and provide therapeutically-relevant knowledge about insulin's effects on AD pathophysiology. Growing evidence has shown that insulin carries out multiple functions in the brain, and that insulin dysregulation may contribute to AD pathogenesis.

This study will examine the effects of intranasally-administered insulin on cognition, entorhinal cortex and hippocampal atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild AD.

A positive change indicates cognitive worsening., 12 months (blinded phase) followed by 6 months (open label phase)","Change in Memory Composite as Measured by Story Recall (Immediate Paragraph Recall and Delayed Paragraph Recall) and Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), Memory Composite is composed from Story Recall (both Immediate Paragraph Recall and Delayed Paragraph Recall) and the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). Each of the three component scores were normalized by subtracting the baseline sample mean, and dividing by the baseline sample standard deviation, to form three separately standardized z-scores with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The three Z-scores were summed to form the memory composite. No other standardization was performed on the sum. If any of Immediate Paragraph Recall, Delayed Paragraph Recall and FCSRT is missing, the memory composite is missing. Higher scores indicate better performance.

The goal of this intervention is to reduce upsetting behaviors and care partner burden. Caring for a family member with Alzheimer's disease or related dementia (ADRD) can come with many burdens that affect not only the care partners' physical and psychological health but also barriers to access. Due to factors such as distance and cost, Internet-based interventions like STELLA are a great alternative to in-person interventions because it can still address the specific needs of families living with dementia. The hypothesis of this study is that care partners will show significant improvements in burden and depression following the intervention. STELLA is also designed to facilitate effective management of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). To accomplish this, up to 40 care partners and their 40 care recipients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias will participate in an 8-week intervention with the support of a Guide (e.g. nurse or social worker). However, the primary focus of this study is on care partners.

NCT03461276,Safety and Immunogenicity of Repeated Doses of ABvac40 in Patients With a-MCI or Vm-AD,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03461276,,COMPLETED,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, accounting for 50-75% of the estimated 47 million people with dementia worldwide. The amyloid cascade hypothesis of AD proposes that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide accumulation in the brain, caused by an imbalance between Aβ production and clearance, is the initiating factor of a cascade ultimately leading to dementia.

Aβ peptides are generated from sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), including Aβ40 and Aβ42. Aβ40 is the predominant variant (90%) among the secreted Aβ forms and although Aβ42 is more hydrophobic and prone to aggregate, and Aβ42 oligomers are regarded to be the most neurotoxic species, Aβ40 can also produce highly toxic diffusible aggregates, which can be prevented in vitro by specific anti-Aβ40 antibodies.

Several studies have proposed that a high concentration of Aβ40 in the brain distinguishes patients with AD from those who have senile plaques but are cognitively normal, pointing to the importance of Aβ40 in the onset of dementia. In keeping with this, previous studies have demonstrated that specific anti-Aβ40 antibodies label NFTs in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus of AD brains, and that these do not co-localize with tau NFTs, suggesting the presence of degenerating neuronal populations filled with C-terminal fragments of Aβx-40. In addition, Aβ40 is the main component of amyloid deposition around cerebral arteries causing cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), which has a prevalence of about 80-90% in patients with AD (for more information see Lacosta et al. Alzheimer's Research \& Therapy (2018) 10:12 DOI 10.1186/s13195-018-0340-8).

Considering those previous results suggesting that strategies targeting Aβ40 could represent novel disease-modifying therapies, we have developed ABvac40, the first active vaccine targeting the C-terminal end of the Aβ40 peptide.

The purpose of this Phase II study is to confirm in patients with a-MCI or vm-AD the level of safety and tolerability obtained in the ABvac40 Phase I clinical trial in patients with mm-AD. In addition, the study is aimed to better characterize the immune response elicited by ABvac40 and to explore its effects on AD biomarkers.",YES,Mild Cognitive Impairment|Alzheimer Disease,BIOLOGICAL: ABvac40|BIOLOGICAL: Placebo,"Average Maximal Increment of Anti-Aβ40 Antibody Signal (Optical Density [OD] in ELISA), Average maximal increment (MΔ) of plasma anti-Aβ40 antibody signal (optical density \[OD\] in ELISA) in each subject with regard to Baseline visit., Part A (Baseline, and post-Baseline visits at Week 2A, Week 6A, Week 10A, Week 14A, Week 18A, Week 24A, Week 40A, Week 44A, Week 50A, Week 77A, and Week 104A)","Subject Discontinuations Due to TEAEs, Number of withdrawn subjects due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the whole study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Physical Examination, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in physical examination reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Neurological Examination, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in neurological examination reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Analytical Hematology, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in hematology parameters reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Analytical Biochemistry, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in biochemistry parameters reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Number of Subjects With Clinically Significant Abnormalities in Coagulation, Clinically significant (CS) abnormalities in coagulation parameters reported during the study., Entire study duration (Week 0 to Week 104 in Part A, and Week 0 to Week 77 in Part B)|Level of Anti-Aβ40 Antibodies in CSF, The change in levels of anti-Aβ40 antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from baseline to each applicable post-baseline efficacy visit (Part A) was analyzed using a Mixed-Model Repeated Measures (MMRM), and the ITT analysis set.

Existing research recruitment approaches are rarely designed to accommodate the priorities, concerns, and constraints relevant to participants from diverse backgrounds. To address these gaps, the investigators developed a research recruitment and engagement model, the Participant Oriented Research Engagement Model that centers and prioritizes relational aspects of research engagement, research participant needs, and systematically address socioeconomic determinants (i.e. unmet needs) that may limit accessibility of research.

Two thirds of the US adult population are at risk for hyperinsulinemia and T2D, and half of the population 85 years and older have AD. Peripheral hyperinsulinemia can impair the clearance of amyloid beta in the brain, the main culprit in AD. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that lowering peripheral insulin in overweight persons with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (AMCI), a transition state between normal cognition and AD, can decrease the risk of cognitive decline and progression to AD. The investigators propose to conduct a phase II double blinded placebo controlled randomized clinical trial of metformin, a safe and effective medication that prevents hyperinsulinemia and diabetes, to test this hypothesis among 80 overweight persons aged 55 to 90 years with AMCI. The main outcome of the study will be changes in performance in a memory test (total recall of the Selective Reminding Test) and the Score a test of general cognitive function used in clinical trials (the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog)).
