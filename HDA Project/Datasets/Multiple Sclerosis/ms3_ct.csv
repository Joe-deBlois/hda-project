The scale consists of 21 items to assess the intensity of depression in clinical and normal patients. Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing severity about a particular symptom of depression. Each item was scored from 0 - 3. If more than one score was provided for an item, the maximum score was considered the item score. The total score was calculated as the sum of all individual items and then compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard key ranges were: 0 - 9 indicated minimal depression; 10 - 18 indicated mild depression; 19 - 29 indicated moderate depression and 30 - 63 indicated severe depression.

NCT00879658,"Safety, Tolerability, Efficacy and Optimal Dose Finding Study of BAF312 in Patients With Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00879658,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study was to determine the dose-response curve for the MRI-based efficacy of BAF312 compared with placebo in patients with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), and to characterize its safety and tolerability for the selection of an optimal dose in a later phase III study.

Study Design Rationale An adaptive design was chosen to characterize the dose response curve of BAF312. In a first period of study (""Period 1""), three doses of BAF312 and placebo were tested for MRI efficacy. Based on an interim analysis (IA) after 3 months of treatment, two additional active doses for period 2 wereselected , thus allowing to optimize the overall determination of the dose response curve with 5 data points of active treatment, and placebo. The doses were kept blinded. The use of Modeling and Simulation allowed to establish the full range and dynamics of the dose-response curve in silico, and hence the definition of the optimal dose for later phase III studies.

The choice of placebo as treatment control was essential to obtain information on the specific compared to non-specific effects of active treatment and provides the best way of evaluating the efficacy and of assessing the true safety and tolerability profile of BAF312. Short-term placebo exposure (6 (Period 1) or 3 (Period 2) months, respectively) was unlikely to lead to longer term differences in outcomes \[Polman, 2008\]. The use of an adaptive design strategy contributed to a significant reduction of placebo exposure, both in terms of the number of patients and duration, as compared to conventional trial models.

Patients having completed the study within the protocol might be eligible for the Extension Phase study where they receive long-term BAF312 treatment (a separate protocol).",YES,Relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: BAF312|DRUG: Placebo,"Dose Responsiveness of BAF312 Based on the Number of Combined Unique Active MRI Lesions (CUAL), Combined unique active lesions (CUAL) were defined as new gadolinium \[Gd\]-enhanced lesions on T1-weighted MRI scans or new or enlarging lesions on T2-weighted MRI scans, without double-counting of lesions.

The Timed 25-Foot Walk was a quantitative measure of lower extremity function. The 9-HPT was a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. The PASAT-3 was a measure of cognitive function that specifically assessed auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. Component scores ranged from 0 to 60 and were converted to standard scores (z-scores). The MSFC score was calculated as the average of the 3 standardized component scores. Higher MSFC scores reflected better neurological function., Weeks 12, 24, and 48|Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of Wellbeing, The VAS is a 100-millimeter (mm) horizontal line marked with 0 mm = ""poor"" and 100 mm = ""excellent.""

The score was computed as the distance from 0 mm to the vertical mark., Weeks 12, 24, and 48|16-Item Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self Report (QIDS-SR16), The QIDS-SR16 is a 16-item participant-rated measure of depressive symptomatology. Each item corresponds to 1 of 9 criterion domains for depression: change in sleep disturbance \[question (Q) 1 through Q4\], sad mood (Q5), decrease or increase in appetite and weight (Q6 through Q9), concentration (Q10), self-criticism (Q11), suicidal ideation (Q12), interest (Q13), energy/fatigue (Q14), and psychomotor agitation and retardation (Q15 and Q16). Each question was scored 0 (no problems) to 3 (increased symptoms). The total score=(the highest score from Q1 through Q4)+(Q5 score)+(the highest score from Q6 through Q9)+(the total score for each Q10 through Q14)+(the highest score from Q15 and Q16). A total score of 0 through 5 was considered no depression likely, 6 through 10 was mild depression, 11 through 15 was moderate depression, 16 through 20 was severe depression, and 21 or over was very severe depression., Weeks 12, 24, and 48|Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Component Scores, The SF-36 was a 36-item, health-related survey that assessed participant's quality of life on 8 domains: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical problems, role limitations due to emotional problems, general health, mental health, social functioning, vitality and 2 component scores (mental and physical health). Domain scores were calculated by summing individual items for each domain and transforming scores into 0 to 100 scale; higher scores indicated better health status or function. The mental component summary (MCS) score, based on SF-36 domains, consisted of social functioning, vitality, mental health, and role-emotional scales (range: 0 to 100). The physical component summary (PCS) score, based on SF-36 domains, consisted of physical functioning, bodily pain, role-physical, and general health scales (range: 0 to 100)., Weeks 12, 24, and 48|Pharmacokinetics (PK): Area Under the Concentration-Time Curve for Dosing Interval at Steady State (AUCtau,ss), AUCtau,ss was obtained by conducting a simulation consisting of 1000 participants, which were then used to determine the noncompartmental PK parameters for each regimen., Week 0: Day 1, 2, or 3 and Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, and 40.|Percentage of Participants With Anti-LY2127399 Antibodies [Anti-Drug Antibodies (ADA)], The percentage of participants with ADA=\[(number of participants who had ADA)/(number of participants assessed)\]\*100., Baseline, Weeks 4, 12, 24, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, and 108|Pharmacodynamics: Change From Baseline in Peripheral Blood B Cell Subsets (Absolute Cell Counts), Cell surface marker cluster designation (CD)19, CD27, and immunoglobulin D (IgD) expression levels were used to define the various B cell subsets.

NCT02687919,Evaluation of a Modified Paleolithic Dietary Intervention in the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02687919,,COMPLETED,"This is a research study. The investigators are inviting participants to participate in this research study between the ages of 18-45, who have stable Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), are able to walk 25 ft with/without an assistive device, and have none of the following: liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, active heart disease, heart block or arrhythmias, bleeding disorders, concurrent diuretic use, anti-coagulation or anti-platelet use, psychosis or other psychiatric disorder likely to impact ability to comply with study procedures, any change in prescription medication for a mental health problem such as depression or anxiety in the last three months.

The purpose of this research study is to determine whether or not a modified Paleolithic diet results in any change in health in persons with RRMS compared to usual care. The investigators define usual care as the typical or usual physician recommendations for the treatment of RRMS.

The Paleolithic diet (or Paleo diet), also referred to as the caveman diet, Stone Age diet, and hunter-gatherer diet, is a modern nutritional plan based on the presumed ancient diet of wild plants and animals of ancestral humans during the Paleolithic era (a period of about 2.5 million years duration that ended around 10,000 years ago with the development of agriculture). The diet consists mainly of fish, grass-fed pasture raised meats, vegetables, fruit, fungi, roots, and nuts, and excludes grains, legumes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils.

To the investigators' knowledge, most neurologists prescribe medications that may reduce or prevent future disability, but few prescribe dietary modifications unless needed for other concomitant disease.",YES,"Multiple Sclerosis, Relapsing-remitting",OTHER: Modified Paleo diet,"Change in Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS)-9 Score, Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that a modified Paleolithic diet reduces effects of fatigue in subjects with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), compared to controls, in: (a) daily life as measured by the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score.

A 9-item sel-report questionnaire related to how fatigue interferes with certain activities and rates its severity, items are scored on a 7 point scale with 1 = strongly disagree and 7= strongly agree. The minimum score is 9 and maximum score is 63. Higher the score indicates greater fatigue severity., End of Study, measured at 3.5 months; Change from Baseline|Change in Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) Score, Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that a modified Paleolithic diet reduces effects of fatigue in subjects with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), compared to controls, in: (b) cognitive fatigue as measured by the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) score.

The PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed and flexibility, as well as calculation ability. The PASAT is presented using audio to ensure standardization in the rate of stimulus presentation. Single digits are presented every 3 seconds and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. The score for the PASAT (0-60) is the total number correct out of 60 possible answers., End of Study, measured at 3.5 months; Change from Baseline|Change in 6-minute Walk (6-MW) Distance, Specific Aims: 1) Test the hypothesis that a modified Paleolithic diet reduces effects of fatigue in subjects with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS), compared to controls, in: (c) physical fatigue as measured by the 6-minute (m) walk (6-MW).

A relapse is defined as the appearance of a new or worsening of a previously stable or improving pre-existing neurological abnormality, separated by at least 30 days from onset of a preceding relapse. The abnormality must be present for at least 24 hours and occur in the absence of fever or infection. The annualized ARR for each treatment group was the mean of the annualized ARRs for all patients in the group calculated as the total number of confirmed relapses divided by the total number of days on study, multiplied by 365.25., Baseline to end of study (Month 24)","Percentage of Patients Free of Disability Progression at Month 24 Assessed With the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), EDSS assesses disability in 8 functional systems. An overall score ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death due to MS) is calculated. Disability progression was determined by the following: One point increase from baseline in patients with baseline EDSS score from 0 to 5.0; or half a point increase in patients with baseline EDSS score of 5.5 or above. A 3-month confirmed disability progression required onset EDSS, 3-month confirming EDSS, and all EDSS in between to meet the disability progression criteria.

A T2-weighted MRI scan utilizes particular values of the echo time (TE) and the repetition time (TR) parameters of image acquisition. Inflammation and tissue damage are seen as bright areas in T2 images and are often referred to as T2 lesions.

NCT04261790,Effects of Ocrelizumab on B-cell Tolerance Defect in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04261790,,COMPLETED,"B-cells have an important role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Ocrelizumab, a medication that targets B-cells have been found to be highly effective in stopping the disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS.

The efficacy of ocrelizumab might be related to the specific pattern of B-cell tolerance defect in patients with MS and the potential of its normalization with treatment with ocrelizumab. By analyzing the reactivity of recombinant antibodies expressed from single B-cells, the investigators' collaborators have demonstrated that the pattern of B-cell tolerance defect is different in people with MS who only display an impaired removal of developing autoreactive B-cells in the periphery while central B-cell tolerance in the bone marrow is functional in most patients. In contrast, patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type-1 diabetes (T1D) or Sjögren's syndrome (SS) show defective central and peripheral B-cell tolerance checkpoints. As a consequence, while anti-B-cell therapy does not correct defective early B-cell tolerance checkpoints in T1D and only temporarily slows down autoimmune processes before newly generated autoreactive B-cells likely induce patient relapse, the investigators postulate that the efficacy of ocrelizumab in MS may be linked to normal central B-cell tolerance and the production of a normal B-cell and T-cell compartment after ocrelizumab therapy.

NCT01144052,Natalizumab De-escalation With Interferon Beta-1b,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01144052,,COMPLETED,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder causing disability in young adults. The management of MS-patients requires treatment with disease-modifying agents, monoclonal antibodies such as natalizumab or immunosuppressants. Natalizumab showed good efficacy and is approved for treatment of relapsing MS with a number of restrictions due to safety issues. Cognitive data related to natalizumab treatment are still scarce. Interferon-beta-1b is approved for high-frequency, subcutaneous (sc) administration in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. It reduces the relapse rate, severity, hospitalisation and the disease activity as seen on MRI.

This is a pilot study to explore the concept of de-escalating natalizumab treatment to interferon-beta-1b e.o.d compared to continuous treatment with natalizumab in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis previously treated with natalizumab for 12 months. The study is designed as prospective, controlled, randomized, rater-blinded, parallel-group, two arm, mono-centric including patients of the Ticino Cohort. One arm will be treated with Interferon-beta 1b 250mcg given subcutaneously every other day, the other with Natalizumab 300 mg given intravenously (i.v.), every four weeks. The treatment duration is 12 months, the follow-up period 12 months. The time to first on-study relapse will be compared between the to treatment arms (primary outcome).

It assesses 7 functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder and cerebral) as well as ambulation. EDSS total score: 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS). As measured by EDSS score, SAD was defined as increase of at least 1.5 points for participants with Baseline score of 0 and increase of at least 1.0 point for participants with a Baseline score of 1.0 or more; and the increase persisted for at least next 2 scheduled assessments, that is, 6 consecutive months. Onset date of SAD was date of first EDSS assessment that began 6 month consecutive period of SAD. Participants who did not reach SAD endpoint were censored at their last visit. Percentage of participants with SAD, estimated by Kaplan-Meier (KM) method, was reported., Up to 2 years|Annualized Relapse Rate, Relapse was defined as new neurological symptoms or worsening of previous neurological symptoms with an objective change on neurological examination, attributable to multiple sclerosis that lasted for at least 48 hours, that were present at normal body temperature, and that were preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability. Annualized relapse rate was estimated through negative binomial regression with robust variance estimation and covariate adjustment for geographic region using observed number of relapses as dependent variable, the log total amount of follow-up from date of first study treatment for each participant as an offset variable, and treatment group and geographic region as model covariates., Up to 2 years","Percentage of Participants Who Were Relapse Free at Year 2, Participants were considered relapse free at Year 2 if they did not experience a relapse from the date of first study treatment to study completion at 24 months.

It assesses the 7 functional systems (visual, brainstem, pyramidal, cerebellar, sensory, bowel/bladder and cerebral) as well as ambulation. EDSS total score ranges from 0 (normal neurological examination) to 10 (death due to MS). Change was calculated by subtracting Baseline value from value at Year 2., Baseline, Year 2|Change From Baseline in Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) Score at Year 2, MSFC is a multidimensional measure consisting of quantitative tests of ambulation (Timed 25-Foot Walk), manual dexterity (9-Hole Peg Test; 9HPT), and cognitive function (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test; PASAT). The MSFC score was calculated as the mean of the Z-scores of the 3 components. A Z-score was calculated by subtracting the mean of the reference population from the test result, then dividing by the standard deviation of the reference population. Higher Z-scores reflected better neurological function and a positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. An increase in score indicated an improvement (Z-score range: -3 to +3).

NCT01142466,A Phase IV Study of Rebif ® 44mcg Administered Three Times Per Week by Subcutaneous Injection Compared With no Treatment in the Therapy of Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis After Mitoxantrone,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT01142466,REMAIN,COMPLETED,"In the course of therapy escalation, the multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects with high activity of disease receive mainly mitoxantrone. The duration of therapy is limited because of a cumulative dose for life (140 mg/m\^2 body surface area). In practice lower doses of mitoxantrone (60-120 mg/m\^2 body surface area) are being used. The specific reason for this limited total dose are potential cardiotoxic side effects of mitoxantrone. Once this cumulative dose of mitoxantrone is reached and the subject becomes stable, there is the question for subsequent therapy. A possibility at this time, is the so-called ""de-escalation"", therefore reducing the subject back to immunomodulating basic treatment.

The relapse rate for an individual participant was calculated as the number of relapses for that participant divided by the number of participant-years followed. The ARR for each enrollment group was calculated as the total number of relapses experienced in the group divided by the total number of participant-years on study., Up to 96 weeks|Percentage of Participants With Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Relapse, Relapse was defined as new or recurrent neurologic symptoms, not associated with fever or infection, lasting for at least 24 hours, accompanied by one or more of the following: New objective neurological findings upon examination by the treating neurologist that are functionally consistent with findings on the EDSS (performed within 7 days of onset of symptoms) with an increase over the prior visit of ≥ 0.5 for the total score, an increase of ≥ 2 in 1 FS, except bladder/cognitive changes, and/or, an increase of ≥ 1 in 2 FS, except bladder/cognitive changes., Up to 96 weeks|Change From Baseline in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Score, The EDSS is used to measure and evaluate MS participants' level of functioning. The EDSS provides a total score on a scale that ranges from 0 to 10. The first levels 1.0 to 4.5 refer to people with a high degree of ambulatory ability and the subsequent levels 5.0 to 9.5 refer to the loss of ambulatory ability. The range of main categories include (0) = normal neurologic examination; to (5) = ambulatory without aid or rest for 200 meters; disability severe enough to impair full daily activities; to (10) = death due to MS. Higher scores indicate more disability. Positive change from baseline indicates more disability., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in Timed 25-Foot Walk Test (T25-FW) Score, The T25-FW is a reliable quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-foot walk. The participant was directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and was instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible, but safely. Participants were allowed to use assistive devices (canes, crutches, walkers) as needed. The time was calculated from when the lead foot crosses the start point to when the participant had reached the 25-foot mark. The task was immediately administered again by having the participant walk back the same distance. The score for the T25-FW was calculated as the average of the 2 completed trials. A negative change from Baseline indicates improvement., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Visual Analog Scale (EQ-5D-5L VAS) Score, The EQ-5D-5L is an instrument designed to assess decrements in health. The EQ-5D-5L includes a VAS and a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension has 5 response categories corresponding to the level of severity (i.e., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems). The EQ-5D-5L VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale numbered from 100 (best health imagined) to 0 (worst health imagined). Higher scores indicate good health. Positive change from baseline indicates improved health., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in the EQ-5D-5L Index Score, The EQ-5D-5L is an instrument designed to assess decrements in health. The EQ-5D-5L includes a VAS and a descriptive system that defines health in terms of 5 dimensions: Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression. Each dimension has 5 response categories corresponding to the level of severity (i.e., no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and unable to/extreme problems). The 5-item index score is transformed into a utility score between 0 (worst health state) and 1 (best health state). Higher scores indicate good health. Positive change from baseline indicates improved health., Baseline up to Week 96|Change From Baseline in the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) Score, The SF-12 uses 12 questions to measure functional health and well-being from the study participant's perspective across eight domains: physical functioning, role, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, emotional role, and mental health. Mental and physical composite scores (MCS \& PCS) are computed using the scores of twelve questions and range from 0 to 100, where a higher score indicates better health. Positive change from baseline indicates improved health., Baseline up to Week 96|Time to Onset of 12-week Confirmed Disability Progression, The time to onset of 12-week confirmed disability progression is defined as the time from baseline to the first disability progression that is confirmed at the next regularly scheduled visit ≥ 12 weeks after the initial disability progression. Disability progression is defined by one of the following: an EDSS increase of at least 1.5 points from baseline EDSS = 0, an EDSS increase of at least a 1.0 point from baseline EDSS between 1.0 and 5.5 (inclusive), or an EDSS increase of at least 0.5 points from baseline EDSS = 6.0., Up to Week 96|Percentage of Participants With No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) at Week 96, The definition of NEDA-3 encompasses a combination of the following 3 related measures of disease activity: No relapses, no confirmed disability progression sustained for 12 weeks as measured on EDSS, and no magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) disease activity, defined as no gadolinium-enhancing (GdE) lesions and no new or enlarging T2 lesions. The definition of NEDA-4 was the above definition of NEDA-3 with the addition of a mean annualized rate of brain volume loss of less than 0.4% where annualized rate of brain volume loss was derived from percentage brain volume change (PBVC) from baseline and was calculated as (\[PBVC/100+1\]\^\[365.25/days\]-1) × 100., Week 96",Biogen,"Alkermes, Inc.",ALL,"ADULT,

The endpoints for this will include assessment of adverse evetns (AEs), changes in laboratory evaluations, vital signs, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores, and changes in physical and neurological examination findings. The secondary objectives of Part A are to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) profile and pharmacodynamics (PD) of natalizumab.

The primary objective of Part B is to determine if natalizumab, when compared to placebo, is effective in treating Japanese participants with relapsing-remitting MS, as measured by new active lesions on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans over 24 weeks. New active lesions are the sum of the gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions and any new or newly-enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions that do not enhance. The primary endpoint is the rate of development of new active lesions over 24 weeks.

Secondary objectives of Part B are to determine over 24 weeks whether natalizumab, when compared to placebo, is effective in reducing the frequency of clinical exacerbations, reducing the number of Gd+ lesions, reducing the number of new or newly-enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions on brain MRI scans, increasing the proportion of relapse-free participants, and improving outcomes on visual analog scale (VAS) assessing the participant's global impression of his/her well-being.

NCT02499900,Study to Assess Medication Satisfaction in Patients With Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Treated With Copaxone®,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02499900,CONFIDENCE,COMPLETED,The primary objective of this study is to compare patient medication satisfaction as measured by the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) scores between the Copaxone 40 mg/mL three time a week (TIW) group and the Copaxone 20 mg/mL once daily (QD) group over 6 months of treatment.,YES,Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Copaxone®,"Change From Baseline in the Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ) to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, Patient satisfaction with the study medication was assessed using the MSQ a 1-item global patient-rated scale. Patients were asked to respond on a 7-point scale, ranging from extremely dissatisfied (1) to extremely satisfied (7), to the following: ""Overall, how satisfied are you with your current medication?"". Positive change from baseline score indicates greater satisfaction with the medication. Estimates and p-value are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA model with visit as a repeated effect: MSQ=baseline MSQ score+treatment+visit+treatment by visit interaction., Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6","Change From Baseline in the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication 9-item Version (TSQM-9) Convenience Score to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, Convenience perception was measured by the 3 convenience items (items 4 to 6) within the validated TSQM-9. The responses to each of the 3 convenience items are reported on a 1-to-7 scale. The TSQM-9 convenience scale is computed, for each subject, by adding the 3 items loading on each response with the lowest possible total score (1\*3 on the 3 items) subtracted from this composite score, and divided by the greatest possible score (3\*7) minus the lowest possible score (3), i.e., 21-3=18. This provides a transformed score between 0 and 1 that was multiplied by 100. The final scale is 0 (Extremely Difficult/Inconvenient) to 100 (Extremely Easy/Convenient). If more than one item is missing, then the convenience scale was considered invalid for that patient. Estimates and p-value are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA with treatment, visit, and Country/Geographical Region as main factors, visit by treatment as the interaction term, and baseline score as the covariate., Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Change From Baseline in the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) Total Score and Subscales to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, MFIS is a modified form of the Fatigue Impact Scale based on items derived from interviews with MS patients concerning how fatigue impacts their lives. It is a structured, self-report questionnaire consisting of 21 items assessing the effects of fatigue. All 21 items are scaled 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating a greater impact of fatigue on patient's activities. The Total MFIS score ranges from 0 to 84, the Physical Subscale from 0 to 36, the Cognitive Subscale from 0 to 40, and the Psychosocial Subscale from 0 to 8. A score of 0 indicates fatigue has no impact on activities and the high-end score indicates fatigue has extreme impact on activities. Negative change from baseline values indicate improvement in the effects of fatigue. Estimates and p-values are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA model with visit as a repeated effect: change from, Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Change From Baseline in the Mental Health Index (MHI) Total Score and Subscales to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, The MHI consists of 18 items and provides an assessment of 4 subscales of mental health, including Anxiety (5 items), Depression (4 items), Behavioral control (4 items), and Positive Affect (4 items), and 1 Total Score. The subscales and Total Score for analyses range from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating not mentally healthy and 100 indicating superior mental health. Positive change from baseline scores indicate improved mental health. Estimates and p-values are obtained from baseline-adjusted repeated measures ANCOVA model with visit as a repeated effect: change from baseline MHI score=baseline MHI Total Score +treatment +visit +country/geographic region +treatment by visit interaction. If a participant skipped x items of y items, the scale was not computed: - MHI Total Score - 9 of 19 - Anxiety subscale - 2 of 5 - Depression subscale - 2 of 4 - Behavioral Control subscale - 2 of 4 - MHI Positive Affect subscale - 2 of 4, Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Change From Baseline in the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) Total Score to Month 6 Using a Repeated Measures ANCOVA, Depressive symptoms were measured by the BDI-II, a 21-item, self-reported rating inventory that measures characteristic attitudes and symptoms of depression. The BDI-II assesses mood, pessimism, sense of failure, self-dissatisfaction, guilt, punishment, self-dislike, self-accusation, suicidal ideas, sadness, crying, irritability, social withdrawal, body image, work difficulties, insomnia, fatigue, appetite, weight loss, bodily preoccupation, and loss of libido. Each of the 21 items is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. BDI-II Total Score indicates the severity of depression and has a total range of 0 to 63. For those clinically diagnosed, scores from 0-13 represent minimal depressive symptoms, scores of 14-19 indicate mild depression, scores of 20-28 indicate moderate depression, and scores of 30-63 indicate severe depression. Negative change from baseline scores indicate improvement., Baseline (Month 0), Months 1, 3 and 6|Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) During Both the Core Period and Extension Periods, An adverse event (AE) is defined as any study-related event that represents a change (positive or negative) in frequency or severity from a baseline (prestudy) event (if any), regardless of the presence of causal relationship or medical significance. Treatment-emergent adverse events are defined as any adverse event with a start date on or after the first study dose date. The investigator determined relation to study drug. A severe AE is defined as an inability to carry out usual activities. A serious AE (SAE) is defined by federal regulation as any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening AE, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Although a subject may have had 2 or more adverse experiences the subject is counted only once in a category. The same subject may appear in different categories., Core: Day 1 to Month 6 Extension: Month 7 to Month 12",,"Teva Branded Pharmaceutical Products R&D, Inc.",,ALL,"ADULT,

Secondary objectives were:

* To assess the effect of the two doses in comparison to interferon beta-1a on:

  * Frequency of relapses,
  * Fatigue,
  * Participant's satisfaction with treatment.
* To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the two doses in comparison to interferon beta-1a.

If no events occurred, the participant was considered free of failure.

Each episode of relapse - appearance, or worsening of a clinical symptom that was stable for at least 30 days, that persisted for a minimum of 24 hours in the absence of fever - was to be confirmed by an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale \[EDSS\] score or Functional System scores., Core treatment period between 48 and 118 weeks depending on when the participant was enrolled|Core Treatment Period: Time to Failure: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of the Rate of Failure at Timepoints, Probability of disability progression at 24, 48 and 96 weeks was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method on the time to failure defined as the time from randomization to failure. Participants free of failure were censored at the date of last treatment.

Kaplan-Meier method consists in computing probabilities of non occurrence of event at any observed time of event and multiplying successive probabilities for time ≤t by any earlier computed probabilities to estimate the probability of being event-free for the amount of time t. Probability of event at time t is 1 minus the probability of being event-free for the amount of time t., Core treatment period between 48 and 118 weeks depending on when the participant was enrolled","Core Treatment Period: Annualized Relapse Rate [ARR] - Poisson Regression Estimates, ARR is obtained from the total number of confirmed relapses that occured during the treatment period divided by the sum of the treatment durations.

In 2nd degree AV Blocks, electrical impulses are intermittent (type 2:1) or delayed w/ each subsequent heartbeat (Mobitz type I) until a beat fails to reach the ventricles entirely. This type of block often is physiologic and observed in a highly relaxed state \& during sleep. In 2nd degree AV Blocks type II, the atria electrical impulses are unable to reach the ventricles, a more serious condition. In 3rd degree AV Blocks (complete heart block), none of the electrical impulses reach either the atria or the ventricles.

NCT02048072,Evaluation of the Autonomic Nervous System During First-dosing With 0.5mg of Fingolimod (Gilenya) in Patients With Relapsing-remitting MS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02048072,ANSG,COMPLETED,"This study is designed to primarily evaluate the impact of Gilenya (Fingolimod) on the autonomic nervous system in patients being treated for the first time with Gilenya (Fingolimod). Effects on the cardiovascular system will be studied as well. The study is conducted to answer the question, if, and if yes, what impact the treatment with Gilenya (Fingolimod) has on the autonomic nervous system. To our knowledge little is known about the effects of Gilenya (Fingolimod) on the autonomic nervous system. We do know of rare, but potentially clinically and therapeutically relevant cardiovascular adverse events of Gilenya (Fingolimod). From a scientific point of view the mechanisms by which this is mediated are of interest. Maybe a better understanding of these mechanisms might even be of clinical relevance (e.g. risk stratification).

The impact of Gilenya (Fingolimod) on the autonomic nervous system is quantitavely measured, using a state-of-the-art technique. Non-invasive blood pressure measurement is performed with the Finometer Pro (Finapres Medical Systems, NL) under different paradigms (breathing at rest, deep breath, valsalva maneuver, active standing). In addition the sympathetic skin reaction is performed. The non-invasive blood pressure measurements are done by continuous, plethysmographic blood pressure measurement at the index finger, while the patient is performing the tasks mentioned above. By interpreting the blood pressure curve, heart rate and blood pressure variability are calculated. The sympathetic skin reaction consists of measuring the change of electric conductibility of the skin (palms and soles) after an electric stimulus of a peripheral nerve. These parameters allow to assess the functionality of four important autonomic functional systems (orthostasis, sympathetic adrenergic, sympathetic cholinergic, parasympathetic cholinergic). Normative data has been acquired in our lab.

Our hypothethis is, that there will be a change of heart rate variability at t4,5h compared to baseline (t0) for the parameter ""RMSSD"" under ""normal breathing"".",YES,Multiple Sclerosis|Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction,DRUG: Gilenya,"RMSSD Normal Breathing, Root Mean Square of the Successive Differences (RMSSD) is one of a few time-domain tools used to assess heart rate variability, the successive differences being neighboring RR or pulse intervals.

In this study pulse intervals were measured non-invasively during five minutes, while subjects were supine, breathing regularly.
