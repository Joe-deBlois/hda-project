NCT03896217,Simvastatin in Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03896217,MS-OPT,COMPLETED,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological condition which is a common cause of disability in young people. It is thought to be an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system begins to attack itself. The cause of MS is unknown but is thought to be a mix of genetic and environmental factors. There are treatments available for early stages of MS, but the later stage known as Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS) has no current treatment.

Statins are a safe treatment traditionally used to reduce cholesterol levels. However, statins also have other effects which could reduce the progression of SPMS, such as effects on the immune system and circulation. A recent study (Chataway et al., 2014) showed that treatment with high-dose simvastatin, a type of statin, reduced the progression of SPMS but no effect on the immune system was seen. It is possible that simvastatin does not treat the immune system but improves how the blood and blood vessels in the brain work in this disease.

The purpose of the clinical trial is to test how Simvastatin (80mg/day) may slow down disease progression in people living with SPMS compared to placebo (dummy pill). Participants will receive either Simvastatin or placebo and will be asked to take 2 tablets daily, for up to 17 weeks.",YES,Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Simvastatin,"Effect on Cerebral Blood Flow in White Matter, Gray Matter, Deep White Matter, Deep Gray Matter, and Thalamus, To compare patients on simvastatin or placebo using multiple linear regressions. ASL is an MRI method that allows non-invasive measurement of CBF using inversion of arterial water spins as a tracer.The aim is to explore whether subtle changes in CBF occur over time between placebo and simvastatin treated patients, including potential waning of the effects of the drug over time., At week 16|AOSLO Measurements of Blood Flow, To establish if Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) measurements of blood flow are useful correlates for cerebral blood flow measurement on and off treatment., At week 16","MRI: ASL in White Matter, Gray Matter, Deep White Matter, Deep Gray Matter, and Thalamus, To evaluate whether ASL is useful correlate for cerebral blood flow measurement on and off treatment., At baseline|AOSLO Blood Flow Dynamics, AOSLO of retinal capillary microvessels was applied to calculate retinal perfusion and measure blood flow dynamics at the capillary level. We measured relative venous and artery blood pO2 levels near the optic nerve (central 3 disk diameters) to obtain vessel width and velocity., Over 16 weeks|MRI: Brain Atrophy, To explore whether statin reduce the rate of brain atrophy, including grey matter volumes, on MRI (excluding the effect of pseudo-atrophy, which is a temporary response to the drug rather than an actual loss of tissue). The MRI images will be analysed using softwares developed at UCL to quantify the amount of brain tissue loss over time., At week 16|MRI: Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is an MR imaging technique based upon the measurement of the random Brownian motion of water within a voxel of tissue. This technique has been used to analyse the microstructure of neuronal tissue in particular myelin and axonal integrity., At week 16|MRI: Neurite Density and Orientation Dispersion Imaging, To assess changes in axonal parameters, such as fiber orientation dispersion and axonal densities occurring over time using NODDI, an advanced MRI technique that reflects the microstructural complexity of dendrites and axons in vivo., At week 16|MRI: MTV, Macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) is a method of myelin mapping to determine the role of myelin loss or changes in progressive MS. With the macromolecular volume being made up of 50% myelin, we are able to use an in-house analysis pipeline to calculate the MTV - a surrogate marker of brain myelin volume. This metric, alongside diffusion weighted imaging will provide micro-structural detail into the cross-sectional and longitudinal changes occurring in the brain parenchyma of people with progressive MS., At week 16|OCT-A: Retinal Nerve Fibre Layer, Inner retinal thickness will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a method of retinal imaging which is non-invasive and involves the patient holding their head still and staring at a dim light while imaging takes place. Peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (pRNFL) thickness is a strong candidate as a biomarker of axonal degeneration in MS., At week 16|OCT-A: Vessel Density, OCT-A images will be processed to produce quantitative data of perfusion indices. Vessel density (VD) is defined as the ""percentage area occupied by vessels in the segmented area., At week 16|Clinical Outcome: EDSS, To examine the clinical effect of simvastatin treatment as reported by the clinician. Clinician observed expanded disability status score (EDSS) is a method of quantifying disability in MS and records changes in disability over time. The EDSS scale ranges from 0 (no disability) to 10 (death due to MS) in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist and encompasses pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel/bladder function in addition to visual, cerebral and other functions. Changes in score (including no changes) will be recorded to determine progression of disability., At week 16|Clinical Outcomes: MSFC: 25 Foot Timed Walk, To examine the clinical effect of simvastatin treatment as reported by the clinician . Multiple Sclerosis Function Composite (MSFC) includes the 25 foot timed foot walk (25TFW), which involves marking a 25-foot distance in an unobstructed hallway; an assistive device (if needed) may be used by the participant and recorded. Their speed is then timed up to a time limit of 3 mins in both directions. Changes in scores will be recorded over the time-points described., At week 16|Clinical Outcomes: MSFC: 9 Hole Peg Test, To examine the clinical effect of simvastatin treatment as reported by the clinician. Multiple Sclerosis Function Composite (MSFC) includes the 9 hole peg test (9HPT). The 9-HPT is a quantitative measure of upper extremity (arm and hand) function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice (two consecutive trials of the dominant hand, followed immediately by two consecutive trials of the non-dominant hand). It is important that the 9-HPT be administered on a solid table (not a rolling hospital bedside table) and that the 9-HPT apparatus be anchored (e.g., with Dycem). The pegs are selected one at a time, using one hand only, and put into the holes as quickly as possible in any order until all the holes are filled. Then, without pausing, the pegs are removed one at a time and returned to the container. This is timed and recorded at the time-points described., At week 16|Clinical Outcomes: SDMT, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is measure of cognitive impairment. The subject is asked to match single digits to symbols using a key as a guide that pairs the numbers to the symbols. They are presented with a page headed by a key that pairs the single digits 1-9 with nine symbols and they then write or orally report their responses in a scoring form. It can be administered in oral and written form and is timed and guided by a trained examiner ie. suitably qualified member of the research team. Changes in scores were recorded over the time-points described. Scores range from 0 to 110, with higher scores indicating better cognitive functioning., At week 16|Clinical Outcomes: Frontal Executive Functioning: FAB, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). The FAB is a brief tool that can be used at the bedside or in a clinic setting to assist in discriminating between dementias with a frontal dysexecutive phenotype and dementia of Alzheimer""s Type (DAT). The FAB has validity in distinguishing Fronto-temporal type dementia from DAT in mildly demented patients (MMSE \> 24). Total score is from a maximum of 18, higher scores indicating better performance. Changes in scores were recorded over the time-points described. The FAB evaluates executive functions through six subtests, including conceptualization, mental flexibility, motor programming, sensitivity to interference, inhibitory control, and environmental autonomy. Each subtest is scored from 0 to 3, yielding a total score range of 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate better executive functioning. The total score is calculated by summing the six subtest scores., At week 20|Patient-Reported Outcomes: MSIS-29v2 Questionnaires., To examine the clinical effect of simvastatin treatment as reported by patient reported outcome measures. Patient reported multiple sclerosis impact scale version 2 (MSIS-29v2) is a self-administered questionnaire covering 29 items that asks to what degree MS has impacted the person physically and mentally over the past two weeks. It consists of 29 items divided into two subscales: Physical Impact (20 items; score range: 20-100) and Psychological Impact (9 items; score range: 9-45). Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale. Higher scores reflect a greater negative impact of MS on the individual's quality of life., At week 16|Patient-Reported Outcomes: MSWT-12V2 Questionnaires., Patient reported Multiple Sclerosis Walking Test version 2 (MSWT-12V2) is a 12 item self-administered questionnaire that measures walking performance over the previous two weeks. Each items is summed to generate a total score which is then transformed to a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater impact on walking. Changes in scores will be recorded over the time-points described., At week 16|Health Economic Outcomes: EQ5D5L, The EuroQol Health-Related Quality of Life (EQ-5D-5L) is a standardized instrument for assessing health-related quality of life across five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain is rated on a five-level scale, ranging from 1 (no problems) to 5 (extreme problems). The EQ-5D-5L also includes a visual analogue scale (VAS), on which individuals rate their overall health from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state). Results are reported as the mean change in domain scores and VAS ratings from baseline to Visit 3., At week 16","Exploratory Outcomes: Immune Parameters, and Biomarkers., Blood samples from these patients will be taken at baseline and at weeks 4, 16 and 20 to investigate the effect of statins on vascular leakage and free radical damage. Biomarkers will be determined as follows: (i) For RNA/DNA oxidative damage serum levels of 8-hydroxyguanosine (8-OHG)/8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG); (ii) Protein oxidative damage will be determined by assaying plasma proteins for nitrotyrosine and carbonyl content; and (iii) Detection of lipid oxidative damage by assaying for the advanced lipid peroxidation end products 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE or HNE), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (Miller et al., 2012)., At week 4","University College, London",National Multiple Sclerosis Society,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE2,40,OTHER,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: RANDOMIZED|Intervention Model: PARALLEL|Masking: SINGLE (PARTICIPANT)|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,16/0730 & 2017-003008-30,2019-05-16,2022-09-13,2023-06-15,2019-03-29,2025-07-01,2025-07-01,"Department of Neuroinflammation, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, WC1B 5EH, United Kingdom","Study Protocol, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT03896217/Prot_000.pdf|Statistical Analysis Plan, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT03896217/SAP_001.pdf|Informed Consent Form, https://cdn.clinicaltrials.gov/large-docs/17/NCT03896217/ICF_002.pdf"

NCT02208050,A Study of the Effectiveness of Fampridine in Improving Upper Limb Function in MS,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02208050,,COMPLETED,"The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of treatment with fampridine in patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS) with upper limb dysfunction (as defined by a 9-HPT time of between 15-90 seconds) and Kurtzke EDSS scores in the range 4.0-7.0 on upper limb function assessed by the nine-hole peg test (9-HPT) and the Jebson Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT).

Fampridine has been shown to be effective in improving motor function, specifically walking ability in prior studies in this patient population and is currently licensed for this use in Europe and the United States. Upper limb dysfunction is common in SPMS and PPMS and often underestimated. Fampridine effects action potential conduction in demyelinated nerve fibres and we would hypothesise that the improvement previously reported in walking ability would be similar to that on upper limb dysfunction. Our study aims to address this question using both independent and patient reported outcomes in the context of a randomised placebo controlled crossover trial.",YES,Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis|Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,DRUG: Fampridine|DRUG: Placebo,"Number of Participants Classified as Upper Limb Responders on the 9 Hole Peg Test (9HPT), 9 Hole Peg Test is a test of upper limb function. Participants place 9 pegs on pegboard and remove pegs - this is timed for each hand. Time recorded in seconds. Longer time indicates poorer upper limb function. 20% improvement is defined as 20% shorter time in seconds. An upper limb responder is defined as a patient with both of the two ""on treatment"" 9 Hole Peg Test (9-HPT) assessments measured in seconds (assessments 4 \& 5 or 7 \& 8) improving 20% from the average of the baseline assessments (1, 2 \& 3). Washout assessment not included in the analysis., 20 weeks. Baseline assessments 1,2,3: weeks 0-2. Assessment 4 - midway through first treatment period; assessment 5: end of first treatment period. Assessment 7: midway through second treatment period, assessment 8: end of second treatment period.","Number of Participants Defined as Upper Limb Responders on the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT) is a timed test (seconds) comprising of seven 'real-world' tasks such as picking up small items. It has been validated for use in upper limb function in MS. A secondary measure of upper limb responsiveness will be defined as number of participants with a 20% improvement in from baseline in the average time taken to complete all seven tasks on the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test ""on treatment"" (assessments 4 \& 5 or 7 \& 8) compared with baseline assessments (assessments 1,2 \& 3).

Baseline assessments (1,2,3) performed in two week period prior to first treatment block. Longer time indicates worse functioning. Improvement is defined as shorter time in seconds.

Assessment 4: Midway through first treatment period (week 4 of 8 week treatment period) Assessment 5: End of first treatment period (end of week 8) Assessment 7: Midway through second treatment period Assessment 8: End of second treatment period, 20 weeks: Weeks 0-2: Assessment 1/2/3; Week 6: Assessment 4; Week 10: Assessment 5; Week 16: Assessment 7; Week 20: Assessment 8|The Number of Mobility Responders to Fampridine as Measured by an Improvement in the 25 Foot Timed Walk (T25FW), A mobility responder to Fampridine will be defined as a patient with both of the two ""on treatment"" T25FW assessments (assessments 4 \& 5 or 7 \& 8) being better (shorter time in seconds) than the maximum of any of the four ""off treatment"" assessments (assessments 1, 2, 3, 6). Otherwise the patient will be deemed a non-responder. T25FW test is the time taken to walk 25 feet taken as the average of two trials. Measured in seconds. Longer time indicates slower walking. Improvement is considered shorter amount of time in seconds - no specific percentage or amount of time was considered necessary.

Scores are summed 1-3; 1-5 for each item. Higher scores indicate higher limitation in walking ability. Scores are summed and transformed to a 0-100 scale again with higher scores indicating higher self-reported limitation in walking ability. MSWS12 scores were collected for the group on Placebo treatment at Weeks 6,10,16 and 20 - the sum of the 4 scores was averaged. MSWS-12 scores were collected for the group on Fampridine treatment at Weeks 6, 10, 16, 20.

This is a 31-item patient reported outcome measure which is validated to measure limitation in arm and hand functioning in people with multiple sclerosis. Patients rate the ability to which they can perform routine daily tasks with current hand function. Higher scores indicate greater limitations. Scale ranges from 0-100. AMSQ scores were collected for the group on Placebo treatment at Weeks 6,10,16 and 20 - the sum of the 4 scores was averaged. AMSQ scores were collected for the group on Fampridine treatment at Weeks 6, 10, 16, 20.

They refer to the self-reported impact of MS on their physical and psychological wellbeing. Higher scores indicate a higher impact on functioning. The 20 item physical scale and the 9 item psychological scale are reported as two separate scaled scores. Both scale ranges are 0-100. Higher scores indicate a higher impact on functioning. MSIS -20 and MSIS-9 scores were collected for the group on Placebo treatment at Weeks 6,10,16 and 20 - the sum of the scores was averaged.
